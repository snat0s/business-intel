## Updated Execution Plan for Licensing Expansion

### Step 1: Define Scope and Objectives
- **Objective**: Establish a scalable licensing business using the back catalogues of current and future artists, complemented by new series to broaden the portfolio.
- **Scope**: Begin with the existing 50 artists and expand significantly as tools, operations, and the global sales force grow. Utilize new offices in Paris, Shanghai, and future locations (targeting 20 by 2027) to reach more artists and clients, driving both licensing and commissioned work.

### Step 2: Assess Current Assets and Create New Series
- **Artist Back Catalogues**:
  - Inventory licensable works from 50 artists (approximately 20 pieces each, totaling 1,000 pieces initially).
  - Review existing artist contracts to confirm licensing rights or negotiate amendments as needed.
- **New Series Creation**:
  - Commission artists to develop themed collections (e.g., seasonal, brand-specific, or culturally relevant series) tailored to attract licensees, especially in new markets like China.
  - Target 2–3 new series in Year 1, each with 10–15 pieces, adding 30–45 new licensable works annually.

### Step 3: Develop the Licensing Model
- **Licensing Agreements**:
  - Draft standardized contracts with legal support to ensure compliance with international copyright laws, protecting both artists and the agency in global markets.
- **Pricing Strategy**:
  - **High-End Licenses**: €50,000–€100,000+ for exclusive, global, perpetual rights.
  - **Mid-Tier Licenses**: €5,000–€25,000 for limited exclusivity (e.g., regional or time-bound).
  - **Low-End Licenses**: €1,000–€5,000 for non-exclusive, limited usage, automated via the platform.
- **Revenue Sharing**:
  - Provide artists with a 50% split of licensing fees to incentivize participation and maintain fairness, particularly for top-tier talent.

### Step 4: Build the Licensing Platform
- **Initial Platform (Year 1)**:
  - Launch a basic licensing website featuring artwork showcases, search/filter options, and secure transaction capabilities.
  - Ensure scalability for future integration with a full SaaS platform.
- **Future SaaS Platform (2026)**:
  - Develop a comprehensive SaaS solution to automate bulk licensing, supporting exponential growth in low-end licenses.
- **Global Considerations**:
  - Design the platform to support multiple languages (starting with French and Mandarin) and currencies to serve Paris, Shanghai, and beyond.

### Step 5: Marketing and Promotion
- **Target Audience**:
  - Focus on high-end brands, publishers, and game developers, with an emphasis on new markets like China, where licensing can pave the way for commissioned projects.
- **Channels**:
  - Deploy the additional sales force from Paris, Shanghai, and future offices to cultivate local client relationships.
  - Promote the platform through industry events, social media, and strategic partnerships (e.g., with local art institutions or brands).
- **Launch Strategy**:
  - Showcase past high-value deals (e.g., with Apple or Louis Vuitton) to establish a premium reputation.
  - Offer introductory promotions or bundles for new clients in expansion markets.

### Step 6: Expand the Artist Roster
- **Recruitment**:
  - Attract new artists via art schools, online platforms, and industry networks, emphasizing the 50% revenue split and licensing opportunities.
  - Utilize the growing sales force to scout local talent in new markets like Paris and Shanghai.
- **Onboarding**:
  - Implement a streamlined process for contract signing, artwork submission, and platform integration.
- **Goal**:
  - Double the artist roster annually (e.g., 100 artists in Year 2, 200 in Year 3), supported by the expanding sales force.

### Step 7: Monitor and Scale
- **Performance Tracking**:
  - Monitor key metrics: licenses sold, revenue generated, artist participation rate, and client acquisition costs.
  - Conduct quarterly reviews to refine strategies based on performance data.
- **Scaling**:
  - Reinvest profits into platform upgrades, new series development, and roster expansion.
  - Automate low-end licensing processes to efficiently manage exponential growth.
