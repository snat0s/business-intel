**Business Plan for Agent Pekka Worlds Studio**

### Executive Summary
Agent Pekka Worlds Studio aims to leverage the agency's roster of talented illustrators and cutting-edge AI technology to create distinctive visual styles that can be extrapolated into comprehensive brand worlds and IPs. Starting from a single image or series of images, we develop cohesive visual styles that can be implemented across multiple applications: brand identity systems, animated films, product design, gaming, merchandising, and other media.

This methodology amplifies artists' reach, creates valuable IP assets, and positions Agent Pekka as a leader in AI-enhanced visual world-building.
