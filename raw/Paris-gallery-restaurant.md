# A New Cultural & Culinary Destination in Paris: Marlo & Pekka

## Investment Opportunity: Where Finnish Creativity Meets the World

We're developing a unique restaurant-gallery concept in Paris's 11th arrondissement that combines Finnish creativity with international perspectives in a refined setting. This cross-cultural concept merges a focused fine dining experience with curated art exhibitions to create a destination that serves as both a gastronomic venue and a cultural hub.

### The Concept: A Culinary & Artistic Dialogue

#### 1. A Refined Dining Experience
- Led by renowned Finnish chef Marlo Snellman, who has established a strong reputation in Paris's culinary scene
- Seasonally evolving three-course lunch menus, complemented by exclusive dinners and private dining events
- A commitment to craftsmanship, sustainability, and storytelling that aligns with Finland's design and culinary traditions

#### 2. A Contemporary Art Gallery & Creative Hub
- The restaurant doubles as a curated gallery, exhibiting works by Finnish, French, and international artists
- Rotating exhibitions will highlight creative exchanges—pairing Finnish artists with international counterparts
- Dedicated "Brand x Artist Collaboration" line featuring both Pekka artists and "fine art" creators
- The space will host artist talks, private collector events, and brand collaborations
- Functions as Pekka's Paris office, creating natural opportunities for client entertaining and relationship building

#### 3. Prime Location
- The 11th arrondissement offers the perfect setting—an area known for culinary innovation, art, and creative industries
- Strategically positioned to attract sophisticated audience of art buyers, cultural tastemakers, and industry leaders
- Creates a visible, prestigious presence for Finnish creativity in Paris

### Market Opportunity

The intersection of food, art, and experiential hospitality presents significant opportunity:
- Cultural dining experiences are in high demand, with consumers seeking restaurants that offer artistic and sensory experiences
- Finnish creativity is gaining international recognition, from Helsinki's rise as a design capital to growing interest in Nordic culinary techniques
- Paris remains a global center for both fine dining and contemporary art, allowing our concept to attract a high-value audience
- The concept creates a natural setting for entertaining luxury brand clients (Hermès, Louis Vuitton) in an impressive artistic environment

### Revenue Model & Financial Potential
