# **Agent Pekka: From Local Ambition to Global Illustration Powerhouse**

## **Founding and Early Vision (2007)**

Agent Pekka was founded in 2007 by Santtu Parikka, Pablo Steffa, and Harri Hännikäinen with a bold vision: to represent Finnish illustration talent on the international stage ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=idea%20for%20starting%20an%20illustration,agency%20operations%20are%20the%20norm)). The idea was born out of a real need in Finland’s creative industry. At the time, Finland had an abundance of gifted illustrators but lacked an established agent system to connect them with clients, unlike larger countries where illustration agencies were the norm ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=same%20roof%2C%20where%20they%E2%80%99d%20be,activity%20had%20not%20been%20established)). Parikka and Hännikäinen – both involved in a digital image production company (Fake Graphics) – noticed this “missing link” between Finnish illustrators and potential clients, especially overseas. They pitched the concept to Pablo Steffa, a designer with advertising and graphic arts experience, who embraced the challenge of marketing and selling his colleagues’ expertise ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=teht%C3%A4v%C3%A4kseen%20kollegojen%20osaamisen%20markkinoinnin%20ja,his%20colleagues%E2%80%99%20expertise%20his%20task)) ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=The%20answer%20on%20the%20phone,digital%20image%20production%20and%20service)). Together, the trio created Agent Pekka (named as a friendly, fictional “Agent Pekka” who would even answer the phone), aiming to bring a new collaborative model to Finland’s illustration scene.

From the outset, Agent Pekka’s mission was clear: *“to make Finnish illustration known internationally.”* This guiding goal was evident early on, as the founders assembled a hand-picked group of Finnish illustrators under one roof so they’d be easier for global clients to find ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=The%20answer%20on%20the%20phone,digital%20image%20production%20and%20service)). By representing a roster of Finland’s top illustration talent, Agent Pekka sought to export the nation’s distinctive visual art style beyond its borders. In the agency’s early years, they focused on promoting originality and high-quality craft, principles that would become core values of the company ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=We%27re%20a%20global%20artist%20representation,Los%20Angeles%2C%20and%20work%20everywhere)).

## **Early Growth and International Interest (2008–2010)**

Agent Pekka quickly gained traction in the Finnish market and just as quickly started attracting attention abroad. The unique styles of its illustrators and the fresh concept of a Finnish illustration agency drew interest from international clients and even artists outside Finland. Within just a few years, Agent Pekka’s reputation for “well-crafted and unique illustration” made it a sought-after representative not only for Finnish creatives but for talent globally ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20dedicated%20to%203D%2C%20animation%2C,diverse%20as%20they%20are%20distinctive)). What began as a local initiative evolved rapidly – foreign illustrators began reaching out, eager to join the curated roster. This was a notable development: an agency founded to export Finnish art soon found itself *importing* international artists onto its team.

By around 2010, the impact of Agent Pekka’s efforts was clearly visible. The agency was proactive in showcasing its illustrators internationally – for example, by attending industry events like Le Book Connections in cities such as Paris, London, New York, and Hamburg ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=Pekka%E2%80%99s%20goal%20is%20to%20make,Christmas%20campaign%2C%20created%20by%20the)). Such moves paid off. As early as 2010, fully one-third of Agent Pekka’s clients were outside of Finland, with projects coming from the United States, UK, across Europe, and even Asia ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=under%20the%20blue,entire%20campaign%20was%20based%20on)). This was a remarkable achievement for a young agency and evidence that Finnish illustrators, under Agent Pekka’s representation, were gaining global recognition. A flagship project during these years was a high-profile campaign for Nokia in the UK, where London’s Wieden+Kennedy agency built an entire Christmas advertising campaign around illustrations by Janine Rewell – one of Agent Pekka’s Finnish artists ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=most%20of%20them%20in%20the,to%20see%20how%20the%20illustration)). The campaign spanned store displays, outdoor ads, web content, print, and packaging, all unified by Rewell’s creative work, demonstrating the agency’s ability to integrate illustration into major international marketing efforts ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=most%20of%20them%20in%20the,to%20see%20how%20the%20illustration)).

Crucially, this early success also made Agent Pekka attractive to non-Finnish illustrators. Artists from abroad recognized that Agent Pekka was championing exciting work and connecting it with big clients. The roster, which initially featured only Finns, soon expanded to include international names. By 2011–2012, illustrators such as Holly Wales and Owen Gatley from the UK, and Mike Perry from the US, had joined Agent Pekka’s lineup ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=The%20exhibition%20at%20GUNS%20%26,Antti%20Uotila%20and%20Holly%20Wales)). This cosmopolitan mix of talent demonstrated how quickly the agency had grown beyond its Finnish roots. In fact, industry observers noted that Agent Pekka’s “eye for talent \[was\] consistently faultless across a whole gamut of styles,” highlighting how it curated artists globally without sacrificing quality ([Finnish illustration brilliance goes Dutch as Agent Pekka sets up Amsterdam office](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/agent-pekka-amsterdam-show#:~:text=They%20have%20marked%20the%20move,a%20whole%20gamut%20of%20styles)). The early interest from international artists validated the founders’ vision: Agent Pekka had become not just a Finnish agency exporting art, but a truly international hub for top illustrators.

## **Key Milestones and Expansion (2011–2014)**

As Agent Pekka’s profile rose, the company hit several key milestones that marked its evolution from a startup to an internationally recognized agency. One of the first major accolades came in 2011, when Agent Pekka was honored as **“Graphic Designer of the Year”** in Finland – a notable recognition awarded by the Finnish design organizations Ornamo and Grafia ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=Vuoden%20graafikko%20graphic%20designer%20of,the%20Year)). This was an unprecedented win for an illustration agency (as opposed to an individual designer). The award citation praised Agent Pekka for *“successfully instilling a new culture of illustration in Finland”* and noted that *“the influence of Agent Pekka on the world conquest of Finnish illustration cannot be ignored.”* ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=teht%C3%A4v%C3%A4kseen%20kollegojen%20osaamisen%20markkinoinnin%20ja,his%20colleagues%E2%80%99%20expertise%20his%20task)). This milestone underscored how significantly Agent Pekka had changed the Finnish graphic arts landscape in just a few years, professionalizing the field of illustration and helping local artists reach global audiences.

Building on this momentum, Agent Pekka embarked on physical expansion. In May 2012, the company opened its first office outside of Helsinki – choosing Amsterdam as its gateway to continental Europe ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=Agent%20Pekka%2C%20the%20Helsinki,in%20the%20heart%20of%20Amsterdam)). Co-founder Pablo Steffa explained that Amsterdam was a natural choice due to “the interesting mix of international and local advertising agencies, the presence of strong global brands and the appreciation the Dutch have for good design” in that city ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=Pablo%20Steffa%2C%20co,will%20inspire%20the%20local%20creatives)). The Amsterdam office launch was marked by a group exhibition titled **“PEKKA IS HERE”** at the Guns & Butter Gallery, featuring works by 25 of the agency’s illustrators from various countries ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=Amsterdam,in%20the%20heart%20of%20Amsterdam)) ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=The%20exhibition%20at%20GUNS%20%26,Antti%20Uotila%20and%20Holly%20Wales)). This event not only celebrated the expansion but also physically showcased Agent Pekka’s diverse talent pool to the European creative community. Heading the new Amsterdam office was Caroline Svensson, an experienced art producer from the local advertising scene, whose recruitment was key to establishing Agent Pekka’s presence in the Netherlands ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=brands%20and%20the%20appreciation%20the,will%20inspire%20the%20local%20creatives)). The successful setup in Amsterdam solidified Agent Pekka’s *“killer reputation”* in the heart of Europe ([Finnish illustration brilliance goes Dutch as Agent Pekka sets up Amsterdam office](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/agent-pekka-amsterdam-show#:~:text=movement%20and%20assimilation%20leaving%20us,the%20heart%20of%20central%20Europe)), making it easier to liaise with European clients and artists.

Following the European foray, Agent Pekka continued to broaden its global footprint. By the mid-2010s, the agency expanded into the North American market, establishing a presence in New York City and Los Angeles ([Agent Pekka — Violaine & Jérémy](https://www.violaineetjeremy.fr/project/agent-pekka#:~:text=Complete%20rebranding%20of%20Agent%20Pekka%27s,%E2%9C%BA)). These expansions meant that Agent Pekka now had bases in three creative hotspots on two continents – Helsinki, Amsterdam, and the key US hubs – truly reflecting its transformation into a global agency. The New York and Los Angeles offices opened up direct access to major advertising industries on the American east and west coasts, allowing the agency to work more closely with US clients and to recruit or manage talent in those regions. By this time, Agent Pekka’s roster included artists from all over the world, and the decision to be physically present in the United States demonstrated the commitment to “work everywhere” that the company professed ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=We%27re%20a%20global%20artist%20representation,Los%20Angeles%2C%20and%20work%20everywhere)). Each new office brought the challenge of entering a competitive market, but Agent Pekka leveraged its strong brand and network of contacts. For instance, just as it did in Amsterdam, the agency likely leaned on local industry experts or connections (Pablo Steffa himself spent significant time in these markets) to establish its American operations. The result was that by around 2014, Agent Pekka had evolved from a Helsinki-based boutique agency into a multi-city international operation.

## **Challenges and Triumphs**

Throughout its journey, Agent Pekka encountered both challenges and successes, each shaping the agency’s character and strategy. In the early days, a primary challenge was **pioneering a new business model in Finland**. Convincing Finnish illustrators and clients to trust an agency for representation required education and proof of concept. Many artists had never had an agent, and many local clients were used to hiring illustrators directly. Agent Pekka addressed this by demonstrating tangible benefits: they made it easier for clients (especially foreign ones) to discover Finnish talent, and they handled the business side (contracts, negotiations) so that artists could focus on art. Over time, skepticism gave way to appreciation as illustrators saw their international commissions grow through the agency’s efforts. The strong professional support and marketing expertise that Agent Pekka provided were new to the Finnish scene, and they indeed “instilled a new culture” where illustrators began to see representation as an asset ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=teht%C3%A4v%C3%A4kseen%20kollegojen%20osaamisen%20markkinoinnin%20ja,his%20colleagues%E2%80%99%20expertise%20his%20task)).

Another challenge came from **operating on the international stage as a newcomer**. Entering established markets like Western Europe and North America meant facing well-entrenched competitors (long-running illustration agencies in London, New York, etc.). Agent Pekka’s strategy to overcome this was to leverage the uniqueness of its talent roster and the reputation it had built. By maintaining a high bar for originality and craft, the agency ensured that it offered something distinctive. It positioned itself as a *boutique* agency with “original and contemporary” artists, appealing to clients seeking fresh voices ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=Established%20in%202007%2C%20Agent%20Pekka,Sony%2C%20Warner%20Music%2C%20and%20Nike)). Additionally, the agency’s Finnish roots – a sort of Nordic design mystique – became a subtle selling point, as Scandinavian design and art held an allure for many global brands. Agent Pekka turned what could have been a challenge (being from a small country) into a strength by proudly carrying the “blue-cross flag” of Finland into the global arena ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=Pekka%E2%80%99s%20goal%20is%20to%20make,Christmas%20campaign%2C%20created%20by%20the)).

Logistical and operational challenges also arose as Agent Pekka expanded geographically. Managing offices across different time zones and cultures required careful coordination. The founders met this by hiring experienced local agents/managers (as in Amsterdam) and by fostering a strong internal culture of collaboration despite distance. The agency describes itself as a *“global collaboration agency,”* highlighting teamwork across its international team ([Agent Pekka (@agentpekka) • Instagram photos and videos](https://www.instagram.com/agentpekka/#:~:text=We%27re%20a%20global%20collaboration%20agency,Amsterdam%20and%20work%20everywhere)). Embracing technology was another triumph – being digitally savvy helped Agent Pekka coordinate with clients and artists worldwide. (In fact, one of the co-founders, Santtu Parikka, had a tech background, which likely aided in implementing efficient digital workflows).

Economic ups and downs tested the agency as well. Founded just before the late-2000s global financial crisis, Agent Pekka had to prove its value when marketing budgets were tight. Its survival and growth through that period is a testament to the quality of work delivered; clients continued to invest in standout illustration as a way to differentiate their brands, and Agent Pekka’s artists provided that edge. Later, as the industry shifted more toward digital content in the 2010s, the agency expanded into areas like CGI, animation and moving image to meet new demand ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=Established%20in%202007%2C%20Agent%20Pekka,Adidas%2C%20Adobe%2C%20Sony%2C%20Warner%20Music)). This diversification was a triumph of adaptability – it ensured Agent Pekka stayed relevant when clients needed not just static illustrations but also motion graphics, character designs for video, and other new media content.

The list of **successes** for Agent Pekka is long. Its artists have worked on campaigns for nearly every industry-leading brand, from tech giants to fashion labels. Over the years, Agent Pekka’s portfolio of clients grew to include names like **Apple, Nike, Google, Adobe, Facebook, and Toyota**, among dozens of other global brands ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=Brands%20include%3A%C2%A0Absolut%20Vodka%2C%20Adidas%2C%20Adobe%2C,Toyota%2C%20Vogue%20Eyewear%20and%20Volkswagen)). The agency also collaborated with top advertising agencies worldwide – from Wieden+Kennedy and Droga5 to Ogilvy and DDB – meaning its illustrators contributed to high-profile campaigns seen by millions ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=Agencies%20include%3A%202x4%2C%2072andSunny%2C%20180Amsterdam%2C,Wieden%2BKennedy%2C%20Winkreative%20and%20Wolff%20Olins)). Importantly, many of Agent Pekka’s illustrators have achieved individual acclaim, winning awards and recognition partly thanks to the opportunities and guidance the agency provided. For example, Janine Rewell, one of the early roster members, earned a **Cannes Lions** award and was named among Print Magazine’s “20 under 30” new visual artists during her time with Agent Pekka ([Janine Rewell — About](https://janinerewell.com/about/#:~:text=2011%20Best%20Of%20The%20Year,FI)) ([Janine Rewell — About](https://janinerewell.com/about/#:~:text=2009%20Design%20Lion%2C%20Bronze%20Cannes,FR)). Such achievements highlight how the agency not only gained commercial success but also helped push creative boundaries.

By the late 2010s, Agent Pekka was often cited as representing *“one of the best rosters of illustrators in the world.”* ([Agent Pekka — Violaine & Jérémy](https://www.violaineetjeremy.fr/project/agent-pekka#:~:text=Complete%20rebranding%20of%20Agent%20Pekka%27s,%E2%9C%BA)) This reputation was cemented by the agency’s consistency in nurturing talent and delivering quality. A mid-2010s rebranding of Agent Pekka’s identity (by the design atelier Violaine & Jérémy) underscored its evolution into a mature brand: the new visual identity evoked the signage of an old workshop, symbolically blending a sense of long-standing craft with modern sharpness ([Agent Pekka — Violaine & Jérémy](https://www.violaineetjeremy.fr/project/agent-pekka#:~:text=Finland%20and%20opened%20offices%20in,%E2%9C%BA)). It was a statement that Agent Pekka, though only founded in 2007, had become an institution in its own right in the illustration community.

## **Agent Pekka Today: Business Model and Values**

Today, Agent Pekka stands as a **global artist representation agency** with a presence on multiple continents. Its business model remains that of a creative consultancy and talent agency: it connects its roster of artists with clients who need compelling visual content, and facilitates their collaborations from start to finish ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=Established%20in%202007%2C%20Agent%20Pekka,Sony%2C%20Warner%20Music%2C%20and%20Nike)). In practical terms, Agent Pekka negotiates projects on behalf of its artists – handling client briefs, contracts, and project management – while taking a commission fee for the work secured. This model allows brands and advertising agencies to easily tap into a pool of pre-vetted, top-tier creative talent, and allows artists to focus on creation rather than business logistics.

Agent Pekka’s core **values** have remained consistent since its founding and have even grown stronger. The agency prides itself on *“championing originality, newness and craft.”* ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=We%27re%20a%20global%20artist%20representation,Los%20Angeles%2C%20and%20work%20everywhere)) This ethos is reflected in how they select artists and projects. The roster is *hand-picked* and kept relatively curated (currently around 40-50 artists in total) to ensure a high standard of work and to give each artist personalized attention ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20dedicated%20to%203D%2C%20animation%2C,diverse%20as%20they%20are%20distinctive)). The artists represented span a broad range of disciplines – from traditional illustration and graphic design to 3D art, animation, character design, installations, and typography ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20dedicated%20to%203D%2C%20animation%2C,diverse%20as%20they%20are%20distinctive)). What unites this diverse group is a distinctive style and a commitment to quality; Agent Pekka looks for artists who have a strong voice and craft, whether they are established names or emerging newcomers.

In terms of **international reach**, Agent Pekka truly lives up to its “global” description. The company is headquartered in Helsinki and maintains offices in Amsterdam and Los Angeles (with past operations in New York as well) ([Agent Pekka — Violaine & Jérémy](https://www.violaineetjeremy.fr/project/agent-pekka#:~:text=Complete%20rebranding%20of%20Agent%20Pekka%27s,%E2%9C%BA)) ([Agent Pekka (@agentpekka) • Instagram photos and videos](https://www.instagram.com/agentpekka/#:~:text=We%27re%20a%20global%20collaboration%20agency,Amsterdam%20and%20work%20everywhere)). It deliberately planted these bases in creative capitals to stay close to major markets. However, the agency works across all regions – it has facilitated collaborations for clients in Europe, North America, Asia and beyond. Communications and portfolio showings are often done virtually or via traveling portfolio events (a practice they embraced early on), meaning distance is not a barrier. The current roster features artists from dozens of nationalities, indicating that Agent Pekka is not seen as just a “Finnish” agency anymore, but rather an international collective. Likewise, the clientele list includes companies from around the world; Agent Pekka’s artists have created illustrations for French fashion houses, American tech companies, Japanese retailers, and everything in between ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=Brands%20include%3A%C2%A0Absolut%20Vodka%2C%20Adidas%2C%20Adobe%2C,Toyota%2C%20Vogue%20Eyewear%20and%20Volkswagen)). Being multilingual and culturally adaptive has become second nature to the agency.

Agent Pekka’s brand in the **creative industry** today is one of trendsetter and quality benchmark. It represents a blend of Nordic sensibility with global trend-awareness. The agency is known for its forward-looking approach – always scouting for fresh styles and encouraging innovation in visual storytelling. Internally referred to as a “collaboration agency,” Agent Pekka emphasizes building good relationships between artists and clients, often facilitating a true creative partnership rather than a one-off transaction. This approach has led to many repeat collaborations with big brands, as the clients trust Agent Pekka to deliver not just any illustrator, but the *right* illustrator for the job, and to nurture that project to excellence.

## **Influence on the Art Representation Market**

Agent Pekka’s influence on the art and illustration representation market has been significant, particularly in its home country and increasingly internationally. In Finland, Agent Pekka essentially **pioneered the modern illustration agency model**. Before 2007, the idea of an agency for illustrators was virtually non-existent in Finland ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=Parikka%20heittiv%C3%A4t%20h%C3%A4nelle%20reilut%20nelj%C3%A4,toiminta%C2%ADmallia%20ei%20aikaisemmin%20ole%20ollut)). By establishing a successful agency, Agent Pekka set a precedent that illustration is a viable export and that artists can benefit from professional representation. This has helped elevate the status of illustrators in Finland from behind-the-scenes freelancers to recognized creative professionals with international careers. It also opened the door for other representation firms and encouraged organizations to support creatives in new ways. The fact that Finnish illustration began gaining worldwide attention in the late 2000s is often credited in part to Agent Pekka’s activities – as noted, *“the influence of Agent Pekka on the world conquest of Finnish illustration cannot be ignored.”* ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=teht%C3%A4v%C3%A4kseen%20kollegojen%20osaamisen%20markkinoinnin%20ja,his%20colleagues%E2%80%99%20expertise%20his%20task)) Finnish illustrators started appearing in global advertising, publications, and art shows, building the Finland design brand abroad.

Internationally, Agent Pekka brought a fresh competitive energy to the illustration agency sector. By curating a roster that mixed Scandinavian talents with international artists, and by stressing quality over quantity, they carved out a niche that some older agencies had overlooked. Their success demonstrated that even a small agency from a small country could compete at the highest level, provided the talent was excellent and the approach professional. This may have influenced other agencies to up their game in terms of artist care and global outreach. Agent Pekka also showed a model of how to maintain a **boutique ethos while scaling globally**. Unlike some agencies that focus only on their region, Agent Pekka remained globally minded from the start, which perhaps inspired a more global outlook in the industry as a whole.

Moreover, Agent Pekka’s expansion to multiple continents hinted at a shift in the market: talent representation in the creative field was no longer tied to one city or country. Following their lead, it became more common to see agencies (and artists) operate without borders, using international agents or opening satellite offices to reach clients everywhere. The agency’s ability to secure prominent campaigns (like the earlier-mentioned Nokia UK project, or later projects for brands like **Absolut Vodka or Adidas**) helped illustrate the value that specialized illustration agencies add to advertising and design projects ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=Established%20in%202007%2C%20Agent%20Pekka,Sony%2C%20Warner%20Music%2C%20and%20Nike)). Their artists have contributed to award-winning advertisements and high-visibility media, indirectly influencing visual trends (for example, some of Agent Pekka’s illustrators have very recognizable styles that have set design trends in advertising and editorial design worldwide).

Agent Pekka also fostered a sense of community and mentorship in the illustration world. Because they represent both **established names and emerging talent** ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20dedicated%20to%203D%2C%20animation%2C,diverse%20as%20they%20are%20distinctive)), the agency often pairs younger illustrators with experienced agents to guide their careers. This practice has contributed to a new generation of illustrators learning how to navigate the global market. In industry circles, Pablo Steffa (the co-founder and director) became known not just as an agent but as an advocate for the illustration art form, often speaking about building strong portfolios and the value of original work. Such advocacy work has had a positive effect on how illustration is perceived – as a collectable art and as a key element of brand storytelling – thereby slightly shifting the market to prize illustrator contributions more.

In summary, Agent Pekka’s presence has enriched the art representation market by raising standards, encouraging international collaboration, and highlighting the commercial and cultural value of high-quality illustration. They effectively built a bridge from the Nordic creative scene to the global creative industry, which others now cross as well.

## **Vision for the Future**

Looking ahead, Agent Pekka appears poised to continue its trajectory of championing cutting-edge creativity and connecting worlds through art. The agency’s **vision for the future** likely involves both deepening and broadening its role in the creative industry. In terms of deepening, Agent Pekka will continue to nurture originality and craft – remaining selective about the artists it represents to maintain that “distinctive style” roster that it’s known for. The team will probably invest in the careers of emerging talents, as they have done, ensuring a pipeline of fresh creatives who can carry the torch forward. Mentorship and development will remain a focus, keeping the agency’s offerings vital and new.

In terms of broadening, Agent Pekka may explore new realms of visual arts and technology as they become relevant. The agency has already embraced fields like 3D illustration and animation; going forward, areas such as augmented reality (AR) art, virtual reality experiences, or interactive illustration could become part of their repertoire as client needs evolve. Their founders’ backgrounds in tech and design hint that Agent Pekka is not afraid to innovate. As the lines between design, art, and technology blur (for example, illustrators now working on VR environments or NFT art, etc.), Agent Pekka is well positioned to represent artists in these hybrid domains, staying true to its ethos of quality and creativity but applying it in new ways.

Geographically, while Agent Pekka already “works everywhere,” the future might see even greater global engagement. We might anticipate stronger ties in regions like East Asia or Latin America, where illustration and design markets are growing – perhaps through partnerships or increased travel and participation in events (similar to how they attended trade fairs in the early days). The agency’s collaborative model could also expand; for instance, Agent Pekka might facilitate more collaborations between its artists and clients in the form of creative labs, residencies, or cross-disciplinary projects, further solidifying its role as a connector in the industry.

Crucially, Agent Pekka’s vision is expected to remain anchored by its **values**. As stated, the agency is “inspired by quality, craft and newness,” and this will guide its future decisions ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20dedicated%20to%203D%2C%20animation%2C,diverse%20as%20they%20are%20distinctive)). In an age where content is abundant and AI-generated imagery is on the rise, Agent Pekka’s emphasis on the human touch and unique artistic voice will likely become an even more distinguishing factor. The agency is likely to advocate for the importance of creativity and originality in commercial art, ensuring that illustrators continue to have a respected place in advertising, media, and art.

After nearly two decades, Agent Pekka’s journey – from a small Finnish startup to a globally recognized creative agency – is a story of vision and adaptation. It has navigated expansions, embraced challenges, and maintained a clear identity through it all. As of today, Agent Pekka represents not just a roster of artists, but a set of ideals in the creative industry: a belief in the power of illustration and design, a commitment to bridging cultures and markets, and a passion for **authentic creative expression**. If its history is any indication, Agent Pekka will continue to evolve and influence the industry, writing new chapters in the history of art representation as it moves into the future.
