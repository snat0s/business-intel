Based on my analysis of both the Priority-list.md and project-dependencies.md files, here's an updated version of the Priority-list.md that incorporates the prioritization framework and enhanced information about dependencies, benefits, and connections:

# Enhanced Project Dependencies & Benefits with Prioritization Framework

## Prioritization Framework

Each initiative is evaluated using the following criteria on a scale of 1-5 (5 being highest):

1. **Revenue Impact (RI)**: Potential to generate direct revenue in the near to medium term
2. **Strategic Value (SV)**: Alignment with long-term vision and ecosystem development
3. **Resource Requirement (RR)**: Inverse score - lower resource needs score higher (5 = minimal resources)
4. **Time to Value (TV)**: Speed at which initiative will deliver measurable results
5. **Dependency Factor (DF)**: Inverse score - fewer dependencies score higher (5 = no dependencies)

**Priority Score = (RI + SV + RR + TV + DF) / 5**

Projects are then organized into implementation phases based on both their priority score and their dependencies on other initiatives, ensuring logical sequencing.
