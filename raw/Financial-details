Current state: The plan includes basic financial information (€3M revenue, 4% profit margin) but lacks detailed projections.
Recommendation: Incorporate a more comprehensive financial section with:
Year-by-year revenue and profit projections
Breakdown of revenue streams (commissioned work, licensing, gaming IP, etc.)
Key financial metrics and KPIs
Investment requirements with expected ROI
Cash flow projections
Consider including charts or graphs from your financial models to visualize growth potential.
