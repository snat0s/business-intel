## **1\. Definition and Scope of the Illustration Market**

The **illustration market** encompasses all **licensed and commissioned illustration work** created for clients or commercial use. This includes a wide range of categories:

* **Editorial illustration:** Artwork commissioned for magazines, newspapers, and online articles.  
* **Book and publishing illustration:** Illustrations for book covers, children’s books, graphic novels, and educational publishing ([45 Markets of Illustration | Communication Arts](https://www.commarts.com/columns/45-markets-of-illustration#:~:text=EDITORIAL%2C%20ADVERTISING%20AND%20PUBLISHING%20A,to%20be%20a%20strong%20base)) tising and commercial illustration:\*\* Visuals created for marketing campaigns, print ads, product packaging, and branding.

* **Licensed digital** ([45 Markets of Illustration | Communication Arts](https://www.commarts.com/columns/45-markets-of-illustration#:~:text=Feature%20films%20are%20not%20the,art%20for%20their%20design%20aspects)) ation assets licensed for use in products or media (e.g. merchandise graphics, infographic assets, iconography, *stock illustrations*). This includes emerging areas like illustrations for web content and social media, as well as commissioned digital artworks via online platforms.

**Excluded** from this market scope are purely personal or non-licensed artworks – for example, personal sketches or paintings not sold/licensed to clients, or fine art pieces created for self-expression and not reproduced commercially. In essence, the focus is on **professional illustration** used in commerce, media, and entertainment, where an illustrator is hired to create work for a client or a license is granted for use of the artwork.

**Illustration vs. Fine Art:** Unlike the fine art market (which involves original art sales through galleries and auctions, valued at \~$65B globally in 2023), the illustration market is tied to ([Global art market value 2007-2023 \- Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/883755/global-art-market-value/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20total%20value%20of,billion%20US%20dollars%20in)) f images in media, products, and campaigns. It is often work-for-hire or licensing-based, where the illustrator typically retains copyright but licenses specific usage rights to the client. The market covers everything from a spot illus ([Guide to Commissioning – Resources \- The AOI](https://theaoi.com/resources/professional-practice/guide-to-commissioning/#:~:text=Guide%20to%20Commissioning%20%E2%80%93%20Resources,of%20the%20artwork%2C%20the)) a magazine to a full advertising illustration used on billboards. It spans many industries, as illustrators contribute to **advertising, publishing, entertainment, fashion, education,** and more.

For instance, in Japan a “creator illustration” segment – illustrators earning income directly from fans via commission platforms and fan clubs – was worth ¥24.7 billion in 2023 (≈$170 million), illustrating how new digital avenues are expanding the illustra ([The Creator Economy Market Grew Remarkably in Its Major five Areas for FY2023 | Yano Research Market solution provider](https://www.yanoresearch.com/press/press.php/3635#:~:text=The%20size%20of%20the%20creator,yen%20for%20fan%20club%20platforms))

## **2\. Market Size of the Global Illustration Market**

Estimating the exact size of the global illustration market is challenging because it is fragmented across many industries and often embedded as part of larger project budgets (advertising, publishing, etc.). However, **industry research and proxies give an indication of scale**:

* **Global Scale:** Analysts and industry experts suggest the worldwide market for commissioned and licensed illustration is on the order of **tens of billions of dollars annually**. One analysis indicates that the **illustration agency services** segment alone (the portion of work mediated by agencies) was about **$16.5 billion in 2023** and projected to reach $26.3 billion by 2030\. Since not all illustrators use agencies, the *total* illustration market (including direct ([80 illustration statistics: trends, career, and more](https://www.linearity.io/blog/illustration-statistics/#:~:text=7,10)) to-client commissions) is even larger. It’s reasonable to estimate the overall global illustration market (all licensed commissions) in the ballpark of **$10–20+ billion per year** in the mid-2020s, given the agency-mediated portion and the significant volume of direct commissions worldwide.

* **United States:** The U.S. is one of the largest single markets for illustration. The illustration industry in the U.S. was valued around **$3.5 billion** as of 2023, with steady growth (\~4% annually expected) driven by high demand for visual content in advertising, p ([Illustration Business Plan Template & Example \- PlanPros](https://planpros.ai/business-plan-examples/business-services/illustration-business-plan-template/#:~:text=The%20Illustration%20industry%20in%20the,Trends%20towards%20digital)) and digital media. The robust U.S. advertising industry (over $300 billion/year in ad spend) and the large publishing sector contribute heavily to this figure. Illustrations appear in everything from national ad campaigns to book illustrations and editorial pieces, adding up to a multi-billion dollar domestic market.

* **Other Major Markets:** Europe and Asia collectively likely equal or exceed the U.S. in illustration expenditures. Europe (with major illustration hubs in the UK, France, Germany, etc.) and the Asia-Pacific region (led by Japan, China, and South Korea) each represent significant shares of the global market. For example, Japan’s thriving publishing (especially manga and novels) and gaming industries commission a vast amount of artwork; as noted, a subset of Japan’s illustration market (individual creator commissions) was ¥24.7B in FY2023. In China, the massive advertising market and tech industry are increasingly utilizing illustration and design, ([The Creator Economy Market Grew Remarkably in Its Major five Areas for FY2023 | Yano Research Market solution provider](https://www.yanoresearch.com/press/press.php/3635#:~:text=The%20size%20of%20the%20creator,yen%20for%20fan%20club%20platforms)) of work is done by in-house teams. While precise global totals are not universally published, **North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific are considered the top regions** for illustration demand.

In summary, the **total global illustration market** – encompassing all commercial and licensed illustration work – can b ([Commercial Illustration Market To Witness the Highest Growth](https://www.openpr.com/news/3583543/commercial-illustration-market-to-witness-the-highest-growth#:~:text=attention%20and%20communicate%20messages%20effectively,leading%20regions%20in%20this%20market)) n the **low tens of billions of dollars per year**, with healthy growth prospects as the need for visual content rises. This growth is fueled by the expansion of digital media, advertising’s emphasis on standout visuals, booming sectors like gaming/entertainment, and even the rise of the creator economy allowing more art to be commissioned for personal or small-business use.

## **3\. Regional Breakdown of the Illustration Market**

While exact regional market size figures are hard to pin down, the **major regions and their relative contributions** are generally understood as follows:

* **North America:** This region (primarily the U.S., plus Canada) is often estimated to account for a large share of the illustration market (roughly 30–40%). The U.S. in particular is a powerhouse, with its $3.5B+ illustration industry driven by Madison Avenue advertising, big publishing houses, entertainment studios, and a strong design culture. Canada’s illustration ([Illustration Business Plan Template & Example \- PlanPros](https://planpros.ai/business-plan-examples/business-services/illustration-business-plan-template/#:~:text=The%20Illustration%20industry%20in%20the,Trends%20towards%20digital)) maller but significant, with hubs like Toronto and Montreal contributing via advertising and gaming industries. A market research report highlighted the U.S. as a key market and noted China’s rapid growth by comparison, implying North America currently leads in size. North America’s dominance is also seen in the presence of many top agencies (e.g., in New York) ([Illustration Agency Service Market \- Latest Advancement And Analysis](https://www.imrmarketreports.com/reports/illustration-agency-service-market/#:~:text=and%20is%20projected%20to%20reach,In%202021%2C%20the)) age earnings for illustrators in U.S. cities.

* **Europe:** Europe is another major region, likely contributing a similar magnitude as North America. Within Europe, **Western Europe** – especially the **UK, France, and Germany** – drives most of the demand. The UK (with London as a global illustration hub) is particularly prominent; it houses many of the world’s leading illustration agencies and a vibrant publishing industry. A recent UK survey by the Association of Illustrators collected data from 25 leading UK-based agencies, indicating a substantial agency market there. Continental Europe also has strong markets: **France** (centered in Paris, with its advertising, fashion, and ([AOI Publishes 2024 Pricing Survey Results](https://theaoi.com/news/2024-aoi-pricing-survey#:~:text=This%20comprehensive%20resource%20offers%20insights,across%2025%20UK%20illustration)) sectors), **Germany** (advertising and media in cities like Berlin, Hamburg, Munich), and others like **Italy** and the **Nordics** (Scandinavia has a notable design and illustration tradition). Europe’s share of the global illustration agency market was significant enough that multiple European agencies rank among top players globally.

* **Asia-Pacific:** The Asia-Pacific region is a **fast-growing illustration market** and possibly the largest region in terms of sheer volume when all countries are ([Global Illustration Agency Service Market 2023 by Company, Regions, Type and Application, Forecast to 2030 \- Infinity Business Insights](https://www.infinitybusinessinsights.com/reports/global-illustration-agency-service-market-2023-by-company-regions-type-and-application-forecast-to-2030-1694040#:~:text=Market%20segment%20by%20players%2C%20this,Agency%20Dribbble%20Folio%20Agent%20Pekka)) pan\*\* has a long-established illustration culture (from anime and manga to gaming and advertising) and a substantial commercial illustration economy. The Japanese illustration market – including new online commission platforms – has been growing double digits and is expected to reach ¥28B in 2024\. **China** is experiencing rapid growth: as the advertising market in China expands and local brands mature, the demand for professional illustration in marketing and product design ([The Creator Economy Market Grew Remarkably in Its Major five Areas for FY2023 | Yano Research Market solution provider](https://www.yanoresearch.com/press/press.php/3635#:~:text=With%20further%20growth%20projected%2C%20the,from%20the%20previous%20fiscal%20year)) ome forecasts, China’s market for illustration services is catching up to the U.S. by the late 2020s. Other notable APAC markets include **South Korea** (home to major gaming companies and a vibrant webcomics/webtoon scene that employs many illustrators), **India** (a large advertising market ([Illustration Agency Service Market \- Latest Advancement And Analysis](https://www.imrmarketreports.com/reports/illustration-agency-service-market/#:~:text=and%20is%20projected%20to%20reach,In%202021%2C%20the)) use of illustration in digital content), and **Australia** (smaller in size but with active advertising and publishing sectors). **Southeast Asian** hubs like Singapore (an ad agency hub) also contribute regional demand. Overall, Asia-Pacific is on par with North America and Europe as a top region and is likely to see the **highest growth rate** going forward, thanks to booming entertainment and mobile media industries.

* **Latin America:** Latin America’s illustration market is smaller in global comparison but still notable. **Brazil** is the standout – its advertising industry (São Paulo is a major ad market) and its large media sector drive demand for illustration in ads, magazines, and textbooks. Countries like **Mexico** (the largest Spanish-speaking advertising market, centered in Mexico City) and **Argentina** have active creative industries that employ illustrators. Latin America might account for a single-digit percentage of the global market, but cities like São Paulo, Mexico City, and Buenos Aires have established agencies and artists serving both local and international clients. For instance, Brazil has agencies such as **Norte** and **Gera** Illustration Agency catering to big brands (clients like Bridgestone, Red Bull, etc.).

* **Middle East & Africa:** These regions are the smallest in terms of the illustration market. However, there is growing use of illustration in advertising and media in the Middle East (e.g., Dubai’s a ([Norte](https://norte.art.br/#:~:text=Norte%20Norte%20is%20an%20artists,become%20experts%20in%20copyright%20management)) ([GERA Illustration Agency](https://gera.art.br/#:~:text=GERA%20Illustration%20Agency%20NEW%20WORKS,Uber%20Eats)) publishing in markets like Turkey). Africa’s illustration usage is relatively nascent on the global stage, mostly limited to local publishing and advertising. Combined, these regions likely constitute only a few percent of global illustration expenditures. The global market is still heavily concentrated in North America, Europe, and APAC.

**Regional Trends:** North America and Europe have a long history of illustration in traditional media (editorial, print ads, books), while Asia-Pacific, in addition to traditional publishing, is fueling new growth areas (mo ([Global Illustration Agency Service Market 2023 by Company, Regions, Type and Application, Forecast to 2030 \- Infinity Business Insights](https://www.infinitybusinessinsights.com/reports/global-illustration-agency-service-market-2023-by-company-regions-type-and-application-forecast-to-2030-1694040#:~:text=Market%20segment%20by%20regions%2C%20regional,a%20total%20of%2013%20chapters)) ics/webtoons, and a huge volume of digital content needing art). All regions are seeing **increased demand for original, visually engaging content** as brands worldwide seek to capture audience attention with illustrations. The rise of global digital platforms means illustrators now serve clients across borders, but the key economic centers mentioned above still generate the bulk of work and revenue.

## **4\. Illustration Agency Market Value and Structure**

Wit ([Commercial Illustration Market To Witness the Highest Growth](https://www.openpr.com/news/3583543/commercial-illustration-market-to-witness-the-highest-growth#:~:text=including%20advertising%2C%20publishing%2C%20entertainment%2C%20and,leading%20regions%20in%20this%20market)) er illustration market, the **illustration agency business** represents the subset of work handled by agencies (artist representatives). Illustration agencies typically take a commission (often \~25–35%) on projects they broker for their artists. This segment can be viewed as the “organized” market channel for illustration, often dealing with higher-end commercial projects and international client relationships.

**Market Size:** The illustration agency sector is substantial. As noted, the **global Illustration Agency Service market** was about **$16.5 billion in 2023** and is forecast to grow to over $26 billion by 2030\. This figure likely represents the total value of projects facilitated by agencies (i.e. the fees paid to illustrators via agencies, which include both the artists’ earnings and agencies’ commissions). It underscores that a large portion of illustratio ([80 illustration statistics: trends, career, and more](https://www.linearity.io/blog/illustration-statistics/#:~:text=7,10)) flows through agencies, especially in advertising and publishing where clients often prefer to work with trusted agents for finding talent. If the top five agency companies account for a significant share (as one report suggests), it indicates some concentration at the high end, but overall the agency market is still quite fragmented with many boutique agencies worldwide.

**Regional Insights:** Illustration agencies are most prevalent in regions with mature creative industries. **Europ ([Illustration Agency Service Market \- Latest Advancement And Analysis](https://www.imrmarketreports.com/reports/illustration-agency-service-market/#:~:text=llustrationX%2C%20Advocate%20Art%2C%20Agency%20Rush%2C,2028)) the UK)** and **North America** have many established agencies – for example, the **UK has at least 25 active illustration agencies** that were part of a recent industry survey, and the U.S. also hosts dozens of agents (especially in New York and Los Angeles). These two regions likely make up the majority of agency-facilitated revenue, since working through an agent is a common practice for larger clients there. **Asia-Pacific** has fewer traditio ([AOI Publishes 2024 Pricing Survey Results](https://theaoi.com/news/2024-aoi-pricing-survey#:~:text=This%20comprehensive%20resource%20offers%20insights,across%2025%20UK%20illustration)) ation agents historically – many Asian illustrators work directly with publishers or via online platforms – but global agencies are expanding into Asia and local agencies are emerging as demand grows. (For instance, agencies like Caper Illustration operate in both London and Shanghai, bridging European and Asian markets.) As the APAC market matures, the agency-model is gaining traction, particularly for connecting local talent with international projects and vice versa.

In terms of **value**, if we roughly estimate that the agency-mediated market is \~$16–17B out of perhaps \~$15–25B total market, i ([Caper Illustration (@caper.illustration) • Instagram photos and videos](https://www.instagram.com/caper.illustration/?hl=en#:~:text=Caper%20Illustration%20%28%40caper,Asia%20through%20illustration%20and%20animation)) hat **a significant portion (perhaps around half or more) of illustration work globally is handled via agencies**. The remainder would be illustrators engaged directly by clients (such as independent artists doing freelance commissions without an agent, or in-house illustrators on company payrolls). The agency segment is growing at nearly **10% CAGR**, reflecting both the overall growth of illustration demand and a possible trend of more clients turning to agencies for quality and convenience.

**Why Use Agencies:** Clients often rely on illustration agencies to *source top talent, manage contracts and usage rights, and ensure quality*. Age ([80 illustration statistics: trends, career, and more](https://www.linearity.io/blog/illustration-statistics/#:~:text=7,10)) market efficiencies and expertise – they understand licensing terms, pricing, and can curate artists to fit a brief. For illustrators, agencies provide business support and access to high-paying clients, at the cost of a commission. Thus, the **illustration agency business** is a vital conduit connecting a global network of artists with the corporations, publishers, and brands that need their work. It adds significant value by organizing a once highly fragmented pool of freelance artists into a more accessible service industry.

## **5\. Top Illustration Agencies (Global and Mid-sized)**

The illustration agency landscape includes a mix of large international agencies and numerous mid-sized or boutique firms. Below are some of the **major global players** and notable mid-sized agencies, along with available information on their scale and operations:

In any case, Bright is considered one of the largest agencies, notable for its focus on art for children’s media and its expansion into the U.S. market (they have a New York office). They recently even started a literary div ([Bright Agency: Revenue, Competitors, Alternatives \- Growjo](https://growjo.com/company/Bright_Agency#:~:text=Bright%20Agency%27s%20estimated%20annual%20revenue,per%20employee%20is%20%24267%2C300)) cating diversification.

Its estimated annual revenue is about **$7.5 million**. Advocate Art has a high artist-to-agent ratio and emphasizes fairness and long-term relationships – many of their core artists have been with them from the start.

  **Global Illustration Market Analysis – Top Cities and Agencies**  
    
  **1\. Definition and Scope of the Illustration Market**  
    
  The illustration market encompasses all **commercial illustration work** that is **licensed or commissioned** for use by clients. This includes a broad range of sectors and purposes:  
* **Editorial illustration:** Artwork commissioned for newspapers and magazines.  
* **Book and publishing illustration:** Illustrations for book covers, children’s books, graphic novels, and educational publishing.  
* **Advertising and marketing visuals:** Visuals created for marketing campaigns, print ads, product packaging, and branding.  
* **Gaming and entertainment art:** Concept art, character design, storyboards, and promotional illustrations for video games, films, TV, and animation.  
* **Licensed digital art:** Illustration assets licensed for use in products or media (e.g., merchandise graphics, infographic assets, iconography, stock illustrations).

In essence, any artwork created to convey a message or enhance content for an organization or product – whether hand-drawn or digital – falls within this market.

Excluded from the scope are artworks that are purely personal or hobbyist (not sold or licensed) and one-off fine art pieces that aren’t reproduced or licensed for commercial use. The focus is on illustrations that are part of economic activity (commissioned by a client or licensed for use) rather than personal creations.

**2\. Market Size (Global)**

The global financial size of the illustration market is significant, given the ubiquity of visual content in media and marketing. Estimates vary due to the market’s fragmented nature, but it clearly reaches into the tens of billions (USD) annually when combining all licensed and commissioned work. For instance, one major component – the stock illustration segment (pre-created images licensed for use) – was valued at around $200 billion in 2023\. This reflects the huge demand for ready-made illustrations in advertising, publishing, web design, education, and other fields.

In addition, the market for commissioned illustrations (custom artwork created on order) contributes many billions more. One analysis of just the agency-brokered portion of commissions puts it at $16.5 billion in 2023, with healthy growth projected. Considering commissions done directly between clients and freelance illustrators (outside of agencies) on top of that, the total commissioned illustration spending worldwide is even higher.

In sum, the total illustration market (licensed \+ commissioned) can be conservatively estimated in the low tens of billions of dollars per year, underlining the substantial economic value of illustration in the global creative industries.

**3\. Regional Breakdown**

**North America** – North America (especially the United States) commands a large share of the illustration market thanks to its robust advertising, publishing, and entertainment industries. The United States alone accounts for several billion in illustration spending; one estimate put the U.S. illustration industry at roughly $3.5 billion in recent years (primarily commissioned work). Major publishing houses, media outlets, and ad agencies in the U.S. and Canada drive demand for editorial art, book illustrations, and marketing visuals.

**Europe** – Europe is another major region, with the U.K. in particular recognized as a global hub for illustration talent and agencies (London is home to many top agencies and publishing firms). Across Europe, illustration is in high demand for advertising campaigns, magazines, product packaging, and the region’s strong children’s book publishing market. While a precise regional dollar figure is hard to pin down, Europe’s share of the global market is significant – likely on par with North America in many segments. For example, the concentration of illustration agencies in the U.K. and continental Europe suggests several billions of dollars of activity in commissioned illustration flow through European markets annually (proportional to the global agency market).

**Asia-Pacific** – The Asia-Pacific region’s illustration market has been growing rapidly. Japan and China lead in demand: Japan has a long tradition of illustration in media (manga, anime, print publishing) and a huge “character business” industry, while China’s expanding advertising and gaming sectors increasingly utilize professional illustrators. Notably, new digital avenues in Asia are boosting the market – in Japan, the rise of online commission platforms and fan patronage has created a “creator illustration” economy, estimated at ¥24.7 billion in FY2023 (\~$165 million) just in platform-based transactions. This is in addition to traditional corporate commissions. Asia-Pacific also sees illustrators serving the booming mobile gaming and animation industries. Overall, APAC’s share of the global illustration market is on the rise, and the region is expected to see high growth rates in coming years as visual content needs expand with digital media usage.

(Note: In all regions, the common driver is the growing importance of visuals for communication. As one report noted, there is a “rising need for aesthetically appealing material” across publishing, entertainment, advertising, and online media worldwide. This trend fuels market growth in each major region.)

**4\. Illustration Agency Market**

Within the broader illustration industry, the illustration agency business forms a significant subset. Illustration agencies are firms that represent illustrators and connect them with clients, handling promotion, contract negotiation, and project management on the artists’ behalf. The total value of illustration work handled via agencies globally was estimated at around $16.5 billion in 2023\. This represents the aggregate fees or billings managed through agencies (including what clients pay for the art, of which agencies take a commission). The agency segment is growing briskly – projected to reach about $26.3 billion by 2030 (nearly 60% growth) at \~9.7% CAGR – thanks to rising demand for high-quality, curated artwork in marketing and media.

**Regional insights:** The agency market has traditionally been strongest in North America and Europe, where many of the oldest and largest illustration agencies are based (e.g., in New York and London). These regions have a mature advertising sector that frequently leverages agency-represented illustrators for campaigns. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific is a smaller portion of the agency market but is expanding; countries like Japan, South Korea, and Australia have growing numbers of agencies or agent-like platforms.

Overall, agencies thrive where there is a concentration of clients needing illustration and a pool of professional illustrators – conditions strongly met in Western markets and increasingly in parts of Asia. Agencies often differentiate themselves by region too: some in Europe and North America now represent artists globally, servicing international clients, whereas local agencies in Asia may focus on domestic styles and IP (e.g., manga-style illustrators, character design for local brands).

**5\. Top Illustration Agencies**

The illustration agency landscape includes both global leaders and respected mid-sized boutiques. Below are some of the major players and their key details:

* **IllustrationX (Illustration Ltd):** A leading global illustration agency (founded in the U.K., with offices in multiple countries). IllustrationX represents a large roster of artists (200+ across styles) and services clients worldwide in advertising, publishing, and branding. It is one of the largest agencies by revenue – estimated to generate around $50–65 million annually – reflecting its extensive operations. IllustrationX prides itself on a broad range of styles and has decades of experience (est. 1929), making it a go-to for many big brands and publishers.  
* **Advocate Art:** A major agency specializing in children’s book illustration and licensing (with offices in London, New York, etc.). Founded in 1992, Advocate Art has a large network of illustrators particularly for children’s books, educational art, and greeting cards. Its revenue is on the order of $5–10 million per year, and it has a mid-sized staff. Advocate’s strength is in publishing: it connects artists with book publishers, toy and game companies, and others needing family-friendly and educational imagery.  
* **Bernstein & Andriulli (B\&A):** A New York-based creative agency representing not only illustrators but also photographers, animators, and other creatives. B\&A is known globally in the advertising industry, often handling high-profile ad campaigns and editorial illustration commissions. Its illustration segment revenue is not publicly reported in detail, but estimates put B\&A’s overall revenue in the multi-million dollar range (roughly $5–15 million) based on available data. B\&A’s competitive edge is its diverse talent roster and deep ties to advertising agencies and corporate clients.  
* **Central Illustration Agency (CIA):** A London-based agency (est. 1983\) representing a wide array of illustrators and animators. CIA has a strong presence in Europe’s advertising and editorial market. While exact figures aren’t public, CIA is considered one of the prominent mid-to-large U.K. agencies, likely handling several million dollars in commissions annually. It is known for its long-standing reputation and a curated roster covering traditional and digital illustration styles.  
* **Handsome Frank:** A boutique illustration agency from the U.K. (founded by two brothers in 2010). Despite its smaller size, Handsome Frank has built an impressive client list in advertising and editorial design. It represents a select group of artists (around 40\) known for contemporary, design-forward styles. Handsome Frank’s revenue is smaller (a few million USD or less), but it has strong brand positioning in the creative industry for quality and trend-aware artwork.  
* **Jelly London:** A mid-sized creative agency based in London that represents illustrators, animators, and motion designers. Jelly (and its sister agency  
* many other agencies worth mentioning – for example: **Synergy Art** (London), **Handsome Frank** (UK), **Grand Matter** (UK), \*\*Meiklejohn Illust ([Anna Goodson / Talks about why Diversity plays such an important ...](https://www.agoodson.com/podcast-branding-matters/#:~:text=,world%27s%20leading%20Illustration%20agencies)) , **Breed** (London, focusing on fashion/luxury illustration), **Agency Rush** (UK), **Illozoo** (USA), **Shannon Associates** (USA, known in publishing), **Mendola Art** (USA), **Scott Hull Associates** (USA), **Astound US/UK** (specializing in children’s books), **Plum Pudding** (UK, children’s illustration), **Oxford Artists** (UK), **2Agenten** (Germany), **VEA** (France), and many more. Each typically has its own specialty or market focus. For instance, **2 Agenten** in Berlin represents a cutting-edge group of illustrators popular in editorial and advertising circles in Germany, while **Plum Pudding** in London is renowned in the children’s book realm.

The **top agencies by revenue globally** would include IllustrationX, Bright, B\&A, and possibly a few others in the $10M+ annual billing range (many of those are headquartered in either New York or London). Mid-sized agencies often operate in the $1–5M range with smaller staff but sometimes equally prestigious artist rosters. The agency field is competitive; agencies differentiate themselves by the **talent they curate, the industries they serve, and their geographic reach**. For example, Bright and Advocate excel in publishing and licensing, B\&A in high-end advertising, while an agency like **Agent Pekka** has a unique blend of avant-garde artists attracting design-focused clients.

## **6\. Top 20 Cities for Illustration Agency Business**

Certain cities around the world stand out as **major centers for the illustration agency business**, due to their concentration of creative industries, number of agencies, and total revenue generated from illustration commissions. Below is a ranking of the **20 most active cities** for illustration agency activity, along with insights on each:

**1\. New York City (USA):** *Global Capital of Illustration Commerce.* New York tops the list given its huge advertising industry and publishing sector. The city’s ad agencies (on Madison Avenue and beyond) regularly commission illustrations for campaigns, and the “Big Five” book publishers (all headquartered in NYC) hire illustrators for book covers and children’s books. Major newspapers and magazines (e.g., *The New York Times*, *The New Yorker*) also use commissioned illustrations. NYC is home to many leading agencies: **Bernstein & Andriulli**, **IllustrationX’s New York office**, **Mendola Art**, **Rapp Art**, **VAZ+Associates**, and others. At any given time, dozens of agencies and reps are brokering deals in NYC. The city’s scale is reflected in high illustrator incomes – NYC has one of the highest concentrations of illustrators/designers in the US – and top-end project budgets. **Industries driving demand:** Advertising (all sectors, including fashion, finance, tech), publishing (books, magazines), media and entertainment (broadcasters, streaming services needing promo art). *Notable agencies:* B\&A (global rep for top illustrators), **Richard Solomon Artists Representative** (specializing in editorial/commercial art), **IllustrationX USA**, **Cartoons Underground** (animation art rep), among others. New York’s illustration market likely generates **tens of millions in agency revenue annually**, given th ([America's Best (and Worst) Cities for Graphic Designers](https://www.movebuddha.com/blog/best-cities-graphic-designers/#:~:text=America%27s%20Best%20,54%2C%2019%2C216%2C182%2C%20%24)) commissions flowing through the city.

**2\. London (UK):** *Europe’s Illustration Hub.* London is arguably on par with New York in terms of illustration agency activity, serving as the hub for the UK and much of Europe. The city has a rich illustration heritage and a **large number of agencies** – at least 25 significant illustration agencies operate in the UK, with the majority in London. These include **Central Illustration Agency (CIA)**, **IllustrationX (global HQ)**, **The Bright Agency**, **Advocate Art**, **Jelly London**, **Lemonade**, **Folio**, **Handsome Frank**, **Synergy Art**, **Breed**, **Heart Agency**, **Debut Art**, and more. London’s advertising agencies (e.g., WPP’s agencies, Saatchi & Saatchi) commission illustration for campaigns, and the city’s publishing industry (Penguin Random House UK, magazines like *The Economist* or *The Guardian*) is a major client as well. **Industries:** Advertising (consumer b ([AOI Publishes 2024 Pricing Survey Results](https://theaoi.com/news/2024-aoi-pricing-survey#:~:text=This%20comprehensive%20resource%20offers%20insights,across%2025%20UK%20illustration)) motive, etc.), publishing (UK is a global center for children’s books and editorial illustration), fashion (London fashion and luxury brands often use illustrators for lookbooks and campaigns), and design/branding agencies. London-based illustration agencies often serve all of Europe – for instance, an illustrator in London might be commissioned for an ad in Paris or Berlin via their London agent. The total illustration commission revenue handled in London is very high, with top agencies there each handling millions per year, making London a powerhouse of the illustration trade.

**3\. Tokyo (Japan):** *Massive Domestic Illustration Demand.* Tokyo is unique on this list: it has a colossal market for illustration, though the agency *model* is less traditional. Japan’s love of illustration permeates **publishing (manga, novels, magazines)**, **advertising**, **gaming**, and **merchandise/character licensing**. Many illustrators in Tokyo work directly with publishers or game companies, but agencies and agents are increasingly part of the ecosystem, especially for connecting Japanese artists with international clients and vice versa. Some global agencies have representation in Japan (e.g., **IllustrationX Japan**, **Dutch Uncle Tokyo**). The scale is indicated by metrics like the ¥24.7 billion creator illustration market in 2023 (which includes online commission platforms), and that’s *in addition* to the traditional corporate commissions. **Industries:** Publishing is huge – every light novel or manga series has cover illustrators; advertising in Japan frequently uses mascots and custom art; the video game and anime industries commission concept art, promotional illustrations, and DVD/Blu-ray cover art; even J-Pop music releases often feature illustrated cover art. *Notable agencies/players:* **AMU (Amana Illustration)** and other local talent management firms, as well as **PIE International** (which pub ([The Creator Economy Market Grew Remarkably in Its Major five Areas for FY2023 | Yano Research Market solution provider](https://www.yanoresearch.com/press/press.php/3635#:~:text=The%20size%20of%20the%20creator,yen%20for%20fan%20club%20platforms)) tration works). While Tokyo may not have as many stand-alone illustration agencies as New York or London, the sheer volume of work (and specialist agent-like entities within publishing houses or production companies) makes it one of the top cities by revenue generated from illustration. Tokyo illustrators are in high demand across Asia, and many Western franchises hire Tokyo-based artists for their distinctive style.

**4\. Los Angeles (USA):** *Entertainment Industry and Beyond.* Los Angeles is a major center due to Hollywood’s influence. The **entertainment industry** (film studios, TV networks, streaming services) relies on illustrators for **movie posters**, **show concept art**, **storyboards**, and marketing materials. Illustration agencies in LA often represent artists who do one-sheets (posters) or key art for entertainment campaigns. Additionally, LA’s advertising scene (serving tech, fashion, and automotive companies on the West Coast) commissions plenty of illustration. Many agencies headquartered elsewhere have satellite offices or reps in LA (for example, **IllustrationX** and **Agent Pekka** have Los Angeles contacts). There are also LA-based agencies like **Innovative Artists** (a talent agency that includes illustrators, estimated revenue \~$161M, though that includes broader talent representation) and boutique reps focusing on animation art. **Industries:** Film and TV marketing (a big source of high-budget commissions), video game developers (LA/SoCal has many game studios needing concept and marketing art), music industry (album cover illustrations, tour posters), and tech (Silicon Beach startups using illustration in branding). *Notable agencies:* **CIA** and **Jelly** have West Coast reps, \*\*Agent ([Agent pekka Reviews 2025: Profile Details | GoodFirms](https://www.goodfirms.co/company/agent-pekka#:~:text=,United%20States)) ice focusing on design/animation illustrators), **Shannon Associates** often works with LA publishers/studios, and **B\&A** has a Los Angeles presence as well. LA’s advantage is the conf ([Innovative Artists: Revenue, Competitors, Alternatives \- Growjo](https://growjo.com/company/Innovative_Artists#:~:text=Innovative%20Artists%3A%20Revenue%2C%20Competitors%2C%20Alternatives,per%20employee%20is%20%24256%2C250)) ertainment and a creative culture, keeping illustrators busy with projects seen by global audiences.

**5\. Paris (France):** *Art, Fashion, and Publishing in the City of Light.* Paris has a storied art and design tradition, and this extends to contemporary illustration. The city is a center for **fashion and luxury advertising** – high-end brands (Chanel, Louis Vuitton, etc.) sometimes use illustrators for lookbooks, campaigns, or window displays. Paris is also the heart of the French publishing industry, including **bande dessinée** (comics/graphic novels) and illustrated children’s books, thus providing steady work for illustrators (either via publishers or agents). **Industries:** Luxury and cosmetics advertising (illustrations in perfumes or cosmetics ads, often with a chic French illustration style), editorial (French magazines and newspapers like *Le Monde* commission political cartoons and illustrations), and **graphic novels/comics** (France-Belgium comic market is huge, employing many comic artists/illustrators). While Paris doesn’t have as many dedicated illustration agencies as London, it has some notable ones and many cross-disciplinary art agencies. *Notable agencies:* **Agent 002** (a Paris-based illustration rep), **Créasenso** (creative agent platform in France), and international agencies like **IllustrationX** and **Anna Goodson** which represent French illustrators. Additionally, Paris has the **Agents Associés** network for photographers/illustrators. The city’s demand is bolstered by events like the *Angoulême International Comics Festival* which, while comics-focused, highlights the economic significance of illustration in French culture. In summary, Paris drives a large volume of illustration work especially in fashion editorial and publishing, making it a top city in Europe for illustration business after London.

**6\. Shanghai (China):** *Emerging Giant in Advertising Illustration.* Shanghai is one of Asia’s largest commercial hubs and has a rapidly growing creative sector. Multinational advertising agencies and big Chinese brands (Alibaba, Tencent, etc.) have major operations in Shanghai, and they increasingly commission custom illustrations for campaigns (especially to stand out in digital marketing and product packaging). The city is also known for its vibrant design scene blending Eastern and Western influences. **Industries:** Advertising (consumer electronics, luxury goods targeting China’s market, e-commerce visuals), **gaming** (Shanghai hosts game companies and animation studios that need concept art and promotional art), and corporate marketing (illustrations for fintech, technology, and real estate marketing are common). While the concept of independent illustration agencies is relatively new in China, it’s developing. Some agencies from abroad have set up in Shanghai or partner with locals – for instance, **Caper Illustration** works out of London and Shanghai to connect Asian artists with global projects. We also see local agencies like **G illustration** or **IllusMania** popping up. *Notable agencies:* **Shanghai Untitled** (a creative agency representing illustrators), **Caper Shanghai** (mentioned above), and **Neocha** (a creative agency in Shanghai that works with illustrators and artists). Moreover, IllustrationX and other global reps have China-focused agents (IllustrationX has an agent fluent in Chinese based in Asia). Shanghai’s inclusion in the top 10 reflects China’s enormous consumer market – even a small fraction of ad budgets going to illustration translates to substantial revenue. As of the late 2010s ([Caper Illustration (@caper.illustration) • Instagram photos and videos](https://www.instagram.com/caper.illustration/?hl=en#:~:text=Caper%20Illustration%20%28%40caper,Asia%20through%20illustration%20and%20animation)) e 2020s, Shanghai is a city where East meets West in illustration, with increasing opportunities for agencies to broker deals for both local and international talent.

**7\. Beijing (China):** *Government, Media and Tech Illustration Needs.* Beijing, China’s capital, is another center of illustr ([Creative Agency \- Neocha](https://neocha.com/creative-agency/#:~:text=Creative%20Agency%20,winning)) though slightly different in character from Shanghai. Beijing is home to many of China’s largest **state media outlets**, \*\*publishi ([Contact \- IllustrationX](https://www.illustrationx.com/contact/br#:~:text=Contact%20,advertising%20agencies%20and%20creative%20studios)) and a growing tech scene (e.g., Baidu, Bytedance). **Industries:** Publishing and media are key – educational publishing (textbooks, children’s books in Mandarin) is largely run out of Beijing, requiring illustrators; state media and news (like Xinhua, People’s Daily) often use infographics and editorial illustrations for communication; and advertising (especially for state-owned enterprises or government campaigns) uses illustration for public service announcements, etc. Beijing’s **gaming and tech** companies also commission art (though some game art studios are in Shenzhen/Guangzhou). In terms of agencies, Beijing has a less international scene than Shanghai, but local studios function in a similar capacity – for example, **CreativeCN** and **IlluStation** are Beijing-based collectives connecting illustrators to clients. *Notable agencies:* While not many Western agencies have an office in Beijing, some have local partners. Also, some Beijing-based design firms (like **MAD Illustrations**) represent multiple artists. Given Beijing’s vast publishing output (China is one of the largest publishing markets globally), the city generates a high volume of commissioned illustrations (think of all the children’s book illustrations and educational diagrams produced). The difference is that much of this is handled internally by publishers rather than through independent agents. Nonetheless, in terms of total illustration work happening (and associated revenue), Beijing ranks among the top cities globally.

**8\. Berlin (Germany):** *Creative Hotbed in Central Europe.* Berlin has become a magnet for creatives, including illustrators, and has a supportive art scene. Germany’s advertising industry is substantial (with many agencies in Hamburg, Munich, as well as Berlin), and Germany is one of Europe’s largest publishing markets (educational and trade publishing). Berlin edges out other German cities in this list due to its concentration of artists and new media companies. **Industries:** Advertising (especially edgy campaigns aimed at youth culture, since Berlin brands itself as young and hip), **media and publishing** (Berlin has many magazines, startups, and tech companies that love using cool illustrations on their websites and marketing). Also, Berlin hosts many **illustration events and conferences**, reinforcing its role as an industry hub. For instance, the Illustrative art festival in Berlin draws international attention. *Notable agencies:* **2Agenten** (a well-known Berlin illustration agency representing contemporary illustrators), **Jute Illustratoren** (an agency/collective), and **SEUFFERT** (Berlin-based rep for illustrators). Additionally, some UK agencies have German representation to service clients in Berlin and beyond. Berlin’s attractiveness to freelance illustrators (due to relatively lower living costs and artsy environment) means many illustrators live there and take international commissions – some through agencies. According to one ranking, Berlin is considered the **\#1 “artist-friendly” city** globally, which indicates the level of creative activity. The city’s illustration market revenue comes from both local commissions (e.g., a German publisher hiring a Berlin illustrator) and work that Berlin-based artists do for clients elsewhere (sometimes via their agents in London/NY). In sum, Berlin plays a pivotal role in the European illustration ecosystem and continues to grow as a creative capital.

**9\. Toronto (Canada):** *Canada’s Commercial and Media Center.* Toronto is the largest city in Canada and the heart of its advertising and media industry. Many U.S. and international campaigns extend to Toronto for the Canadian market, and the city’s own ad ([Top 15 Artist-Friendly Cities: A Creative Haven for Your Next Chapter](https://www.artmiabo.com/2024/07/top-15-artist-friendly-cities-creative.html#:~:text=Chapter%20www,Chiang%20Mai%2C%20Thailand%3A%20%C2%B7%204)) encies (like those serving the banking, telecom, and retail sectors) commission illustrations. Toronto also has a sizable publishing industry (including Canadian divisions of major book publishers and numerous magazines). **Industries:** Advertising (consumer brands, tourism, retail), publishing (there’s a strong market for children’s books and educational publishing in Canada), and **corporate communications** (illustrations for annual reports, infographics for government or corporate outreach are common). *Notable agencies:* While Canada doesn’t have as many large illustration agencies as the US/UK, it does have **Anna Goodson Illustration Agency** in Montreal which serves all of Canada (and globally) – many Toronto clients work with AGIA for talent. Toronto also has agencies like **Illustration Online** (formerly “Three in a Box”) which historically was a big collective of Canadian illustrators. **House of Illustration** (Toronto) and **Shard Illustration** are smaller reps there. Additionally, global agencies often handle Canadian projects out of New York or London, but the volume of work centered in Toronto is high enough to rank it in the global top 10\. The city’s illustrators often straddle the U.S. market as well, given geographic proximity. Toronto’s importance is further seen in events like **TCAF (Toronto Comic Arts Festival)**, indicating a strong appreciation and market for illustration (in comic ([Anna Goodson / Talks about why Diversity plays such an important ...](https://www.agoodson.com/podcast-branding-matters/#:~:text=,world%27s%20leading%20Illustration%20agencies)) .

**10\. Chicago (USA):** *Advertising and Publishing Hub of the U.S. Midwest.* Chicago boasts a historically strong advertising industry – big consumer goods companies (McDonald’s, Kraft, etc.) and marketing firms are headquartered in Chicago. These companies frequently need illustration for packaging, advertising, and social media. Chicago is also known for its **publishing of children’s books and educational materials** (several educational publishing companies are or were based in the area, and magazines like *Playboy* were founded there). **Industries:** Advertising is number one (especially for food, beverage, and corporate advertising – Chicago agencies handle many national campaigns), followed by publishing/education (e.g., **Scott Foresman** and other textbook publishers historically commissioned lots of illustration in Chicago). The design and architecture sector in Chicago also uses technical illustrators (for infographics, architectural renderings). *Notable agencies:* **MCB Illustration** and **Scott Hull Associates** (though Scott Hull is based in Ohio, he represents many artists in the Midwest). There’s also **Visual Connections** in Chicago, and agencies like **Mendola** or **Rapp Art** from NY often visit Chicago clients. The city has a large pool of freelance illustrators and cartoonists, supported by entities like the **Chicago Society of Illustrators**. While some work is routed through New York agents, Chicago generates a significant amount of illustration business in its own right – enough to place it comfortably in the global top 20 cities.

**11\. San Francisco (USA):** *Tech Industry Infuses Illustration Demand.* San Francisco and the Bay Area have become a prominent market for illustration thanks to the tech sector. Companies like Google, Facebook (Meta), Apple, and countless startups have popularized the use of **illustration in user interfaces, branding, and advertising** – think of the many websites/apps adorned with custom illustration to convey friendliness or explain services. The Bay Area’s design aesthetic often includes whimsical or flat-style illustrations, creating a steady stream of work for illustrators. **Industries:** Technology (illustrations for app tutorials, marketing websites, and explainer videos), **finance** (San Francisco’s fintech and finance companies using illustration for simplification of complex info), and **editorial media** (tech-oriented publications like *Wired*, based in SF, famously use bold illustration). There’s also a significant gaming presence (with companies like Electronic Arts, and many mobile game developers in SF) that commission concept art and marketing art. *Notable agencies:* Some specialized agencies popped up in SF to serve tech (e.g., **500px Prime** for stock illustration, though more a platform). However, most illustration work in SF might be handled by design agencies or directly by in-house teams. Still, agencies like **IllustrationX** have West Coast agents, and **Agent Pekka** has clients in SF given the tech focus on infographics and icons (Agent Pekka itself highlights iconography as a specialty). Additionally, **Giant Artists** and **John Brewster Creative** are reps that handle illustrators in the Bay Area. A statistic reflecting SF’s prominence: a study found **San Francisco to be the top city for “graphic illustrators” in the U.S.** based on salary and opportunity. This is likely due to high tech salaries and demand. In summary, SF’s role in the illustration market is relatively new but huge – it transformed how modern brands use illustration, thus injecting significant revenue into the field via corporate commissions.

**12\. Singapore:** *Asia-Pacific Regional Agency Hub.* Singapore, while a small city-state, punches above its weight as a business and advertis ([Agent pekka Reviews 2025: Profile Details | GoodFirms](https://www.goodfirms.co/company/agent-pekka#:~:text=Agent%20Pekka%20is%20an%20illustration,diverse%20as%20they%20are%20distinctive)) theast Asia. Many multinational companies have their APAC regional headquarters in Singapore, and major advertising networks (Ogilvy, Publicis, etc.) run Southeast Asian campaigns from there. As a result, illustration agencies and reps find work in Singapore by servicing these ([10 Best Cities For Graphics Illustrators In 2025 \- Zippia](https://www.zippia.com/graphics-illustrator-jobs/best-cities/#:~:text=The%20best%20cities%20for%20graphics,and%20job%20availability%20per)) **Industries:** Advertising (particularly regional campaigns for finance, telecom, airlines, and tourism often originate in Singapore), **public sector** (the Singapore government and related entities frequently use infographics and illustrations for public communications, e.g., educational campaigns), and **branding/design** (Singapore’s design studios create a lot of illustrated graphics for corporate clients). *Notable agencies:* There are a few local agencies/collectives, like **OIC Singapore** (Organisation of Illustrators Council, which, while more of a community, functions to connect illustrators with jobs). International agencies cover Singapore by assignment – e.g., IllustrationX and others take on Singapore projects. An example of the city’s significance: **Illustration Arts Festival** is held in Singapore, indicating a growing market and community. Additionally, some illustrators from nearby countries (Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines) get representation or work through Singapore contacts. While Singapore’s population is small, the high concentration of business means a steady flow of commissions (often with healthy budgets). It likely ranks as one of Asia’s top locales for illustration commissions after the big East Asian capitals.

**13\. Hong Kong:** *Gateway to Chinese and APAC Markets.* Traditionally, Hong Kong was a leading advertising center for East Asia – many international ad agencies had HK offices to handle Greater China and pan-Asian accounts. Although Hong Kong’s role is changing in recent years, it remains a place where a lot of **marketing and design work** takes place. **Industries:** Advertising (especially luxury retail, given HK’s importance in luxury markets; also banking and finance marketing often has APAC creative based in HK), **publishing** (HK has a mix of Chinese and English-language publications and publishers that use illustration), and **entertainment** (the HK film industry and event promotion sometimes involve illustrators for posters, though less so now than in its heyday). *Notable agencies:* **Illo Agency** (an agency that represents Asian illustrators, possibly with presence in HK as they list global artists including Chinese), and **China Illustration** (a network operating between HK/China). Also, many Western agencies have reps in HK (for example, **Illustration Ltd** historically had an agent covering HK/China). Hong Kong’s bilingual environment made it a conduit for Western clients to hire Asian illustrators or vice versa. With the growth of Shenzhen/Guangzhou creative scenes, HK’s dominance is a bit reduced, but it still generates significant illustration business, particularly for projects that aim for a pan-Asian audience. The number of agencies physically in HK might be limited, but the city’s advertising sector ensures a volume of commissions that justifies inclusion in the top 20\.

\**14\. Amsterdam (Netherla ([Jiarui Jiang is an illustrator and storyteller based in China \- Illo Agency](https://illo.agency/news/jiarui-jiang-is-an-illustrator-and-storyteller-based-in-china#:~:text=Jiarui%20Jiang%20is%20an%20illustrator,minded%20clients)) tive Advertising and Design Center.* Amsterdam is known for its creative advertising industry, hosting top agencies that produce campaigns for global brands (Heineken, Nike’s European campaigns, etc.). The city has a strong design sensibility and appreciation for illustration – Dutch graphic design often incorporates illustration. **Industries:** Advertising (Amsterdam agencies often handle international campaigns that require high-end illustration, e.g., for beer, electronics, and travel brands), **branding and design** (many design studios in the Netherlands use custom illustration for packaging and identity work), and **publishing** (while not as large as London or NY, Amsterdam has some publishing, especially art book and editorial publishing that uses illustrators). *Notable agencies:* **Agent Pekka’s European office is in Amsterdam**, drawn by the mix of global advertising agencies and design-savvy culture. Also, **Shop Around** is a prominent Amsterdam-based illustration agency representing local and international talent. **Illustration Daily** (an online platform) and the **Dutch Illustrators Guild (Illustratoren Nederland)** are based in NL, supporting the trade. Amsterdam’s creative reputation (“Dutch Design”) helps illustrators – clients often seek out Dutch illustrators for their distinct style. Many UK and US agencies also travel to Amsterdam for business since so many global brand HQs or marketing departments are there (e.g., Adidas, though a German company, has design teams in Amsterdam that commission illustration). In terms of revenue, Amsterdam likely generates a high per-capita amount of illustrat ([Finnish illustration brilliance goes Dutch as Agent Pekka sets up Amsterdam office](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/agent-pekka-amsterdam-show#:~:text=the%20best%20local%20Dutch%20talent,%E2%80%9D)) a smaller city, but very concentrated in creative industries. It serves as a hub for Northern Europe’s illustration commissions.

**15\. Seoul (South Korea):** *Gaming and Pop Culture Illustration Nexus.* Seoul has become a significant market, mainly propelled by South Korea’s massive **gaming industry** and the rise of **K-pop/pop culture** that utilizes a lot of art. Many popular mobile games (and PC games) are developed in Korea, and illustrators are needed for character design, concept art, and promotional artwork. Additionally, Korea’s webtoon (online comics) industry is huge and, while often creator-owned, has spawned a professional ecosystem for comic illustrators (some of whom crossover into commercial illustration). **Industries:** Video games (companies like NCSoft, Nexon, Netmarble – all Seoul-based – employ or contract armies of illustrators), **publishing** (Korean publishers of novels and educational content commission illustrators; also the manhwa/webtoon publishers), and **advertising** (Korean advertising is vibrant, sometimes using anime-style or cute character illustrations in ads for consumer products and tech). K-pop music labels also commission illustrators for album art, merchandise (stickers, character goods of idols), and animated music videos. *Notable agencies:* South Korea has a few illustration reps – e.g., **Yeon Illustration Agency** connects international illustrators with clients in Korea. There are also talent agencies that manage webtoon artists who occasionally take on commercial jobs. International agencies haven’t deeply penetrated Korea yet, but some Korean illustrators are represented by overseas agents to get work outside Korea. Seoul’s illustration market value is significant domestically (many illustrators make a good living via game and comic work), and an increasing amount flows through agencies or agent-like platforms. Seoul ranks in the top 20 for the sheer volume of illustration content produced for its entertainment sector.

**16\. Sydney (Australia):** *Advertising and Media in Oceania.* Sydney is Australia’s largest city and the center of its advertising industry. Many multi-national campa ([Yeon Illustration Agency](https://yeonagency.com/#:~:text=Yeon%20Illustration%20Agency%20Yeon%20illustration,B%3B%20C%3B%20D%3B%20E)) Australian market are created in Sydney, and it’s home to branches of global ad agency networks. **Industries:** Advertising (especially for finance, retail, and government campaigns in Australia – e.g., banks, tourism boards commissioning illustration for ads), **media** (Sydney has major newspapers and magazines that use illustration, e.g., *The Sydney Morning Herald* might hire illustrators for feature stories), and **film/TV** (to a smaller extent, but Australia’s film industry and events sometimes need poster art or storyboards). *Notable agencies:* **The Illustration Room** is a Sydney-based agency representing Australian illustrators for advertising and publishing. **Jacky Winter Group**, while headquartered in Melbourne, works extensively with Sydney clients (and indeed has artists across Australia and internationally). Sydney’s role is often as the client location – e.g., a Sydney ad agency might hire an illustrator via an agent in London or Melbourne. But there are local agents: **Illustration Ltd** (IllustrationX) has had Australian agents, and **Creatives Uncovered** is a network in Australia. In terms of volume, the Australian market is smaller than North America/Europe, but Sydney likely accounts for the majority of it, hence its place in the top 20\. Also, being in Asia-Pacific, Sydney agencies sometimes collaborate on Asia-wide projects, giving them additional reach.

**17\. Melbourne (Australia):** *Design and Publishing Heart in Australia.* Melbourne is another Australian hub with a strong art and design community. It is known for its **publishing industry** (several publishers and educational content creators are based there) and a vibrant local design scene. **Industries:** Publishing (Melbourne is a UNESCO City of Literature, hosting many book publishers and literary magazines – illustrators get work in children’s books and book cover illustration here), **advertising/design** (some creative agencies prefer Melbourne’s scene, plus the city has many events that commission illustration, like the Melbourne arts festival posters, etc.), and **animation/film** (Melbourne has animation studios where illustrators contribute concept art). *Notable agencies:* **Jacky Winter Group** – a famous illustration agency that started in Melbourne – represents a roster of Australian and international talent and connects them to clients worldwide. Jacky Winter has been highly successful, essentially putting Melbourne on the map for illustration representation. Other local agencies include **The Handsome Frank Australia** (extension of UK’s Handsome Frank) and independent reps like **Nanda\\Hobbs Illustration**. Melbourne illustrators also often work directly with the many design studios in the city (some acting as quasi-agents by bringing freelance illustrators onto projects). Combined with Sydney, Melbourne covers virtually all of Australia’s significant illustration commissions. We list it separately because of its distinct contribution (particularly in publishing and design).

**18\. Montréal (Canada):** *Gaming and Publishing (Francophone and Anglophone).* Montreal is Canada’s second city for illustration after Toronto, with some unique drivers. It’s a major **video game development center** (hosting studios for Ubisoft, EA, etc.), which generates a lot of concept art and game illustration work. It’s also the center of Francophone Canadian publishing (children’s books, comics, etc. in French) and has a vibrant comic art scene (influenced by European comics). **Industries:** Gaming (concept illustrators and character designers in high demand; many of these artists are represented by agents when freelancing), **advertising** (Montreal’s ad scene caters to Quebec and often has a distinct style; illustrators are used in ads and marketing materials, sometimes with a more artistic/indie flair reflective of Montreal’s culture), and **publishing/media** (illustration for French-language magazines, educational materials for Canadian schools, etc.). *Notable agencies:* **Anna Goodson Illustration Agency** is headquartered in Montreal and is internationally recognized – it represents artists globally and serves clients in North America and Europe. This agency’s presence alone makes Montreal significant in the agency world. Also, **Illustration Québec** is an association that promotes illustrators and connects them with clients (not an agency per se, but a structured marketplace for Montreal illustrators). Additionally, some U.S. agencies recruit Montreal talent due to the city’s pool of skilled artists (many coming out of schools like Concordia or UQAM). Considering the volume of work (especially from the game industry in Montreal, which often goes untracked publicly because work is in-house or contracted), Montreal likely generates a large sum of illustration work value, justifying a spot in the ([Anna Goodson / Talks about why Diversity plays such an important ...](https://www.agoodson.com/podcast-branding-matters/#:~:text=,world%27s%20leading%20Illustration%20agencies)) . São Paulo (Brazil):\*\* *Latin America’s Largest Advertising Market.* São Paulo is the economic engine of Brazil and home to its biggest advertising agencies and media companies. Many global brands’ Latin American campaigns are created in São Paulo (or adapted by São Paulo agencies), leading to demand for commercial illustration and animation. **Industries:** Advertising is the big one – Brazil’s advertising spend is the highest in Latin America, and São Paulo agencies create work for consumer goods, telecom, banking, and especially **creative TV commercials and print ads** that often utilize illustration (Brazil has an award-winning ad industry known for creative visuals). Additionally, **editorial** (São Paulo has many magazines, newspapers, and an emerging startup scene creating content that uses illustration). Brazil also has a **comic and animation** scene (e.g., MSP’s Monica’s Gang comics), but those are more internal. *Notable agencies:* There are illustration agencies like **Norte** in São Paulo which specialize in artists’ representation and copyright management for the Brazilian market. **GERA Illustration Agency** (also in Brazil) showcases work for clients like Greenpeace, Red Bull, Panini, etc., indicating a diverse client base. International agencies haven’t deeply entered Brazil due to language and market differences, so local agencies fill the gap. Also, artists like those in the **Collectivemind** or **LAB607** often collaborate on commercial work. The city’s inclusion in the top 20 is warranted by the sheer size of Brazil’s ad market and the presence of multiple specialist agencies – collectively, São Paulo’s illustration commissions (from magazine spots to big ad campaigns and design projects) represent the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.

**20\. Mexico City (Mexico):** \*Advertising and Media for the Spanish-Speaki ([Norte](https://norte.art.br/#:~:text=Norte%20Norte%20is%20an%20artists,become%20experts%20in%20copyright%20management)) exico City is a powerhouse in the Spanish-language advertising world. It serves not only Mexico (a nation of 120M people) but often the broader Lat ([GERA Illustration Agency](https://gera.art.br/#:~:text=GERA%20Illustration%20Agency%20NEW%20WORKS,Uber%20Eats)) market as a creative center. **Industries:** Advertising (major multinational ad agencies operate in CDMX, creating campaigns for consumer products, soda brands, etc., many of which employ illustration especially in print/outdoor and increasingly in digital content), **publishing** (Mexico has a sizeable publishing industry for textbooks and literature – illustrators are commissioned for children’s books and educational illustrations in large numbers by publishers like Fondo de Cultura, etc.), and **film/TV** (Mexico’s film industry and streaming content sometimes use illustrators for poster art or animation storyboard – e.g., animated segments in films, or poster art for the vibrant film festival scene). *Notable agencies:* Mexico has some local illustration agencies or artist reps (though not as internationally famous). For instance, **Pequeño Press** doubles as a boutique agency for illustrators, and **Grupo Ilustradores** is a network. Many Mexican illustrators also join Latin American collectives or get representation through Spain/US agencies for international work. Nevertheless, Mexico City’s creative industry size ensures constant demand for artwork – one indicator, the number of animation and design studios in Mexico City that routinely hire freelance illustrators. In Latin America, Mexico’s illustration market is second only to Brazil’s. Given its regional influence and the confluence of media in the capital, Mexico City rounds out the top 20 list.

**(Honorable Mentions):** Other cities are also notable but just outside the top 20 by revenue: **Moscow** (Russia’s advertising and publishing center, though somewhat insular), **Mumbai** (India’s advertising industry is large, but illustrators are often employed in-house or through design firms rather than agencies, keeping it just out of the top tier), **Madrid** (Spain’s capital has a robust illustration scene for advertising and one of the world’s largest comic/children’s book fairs in nearby Bologna, but many Spanish illustrators are actually represented through UK or French agencies), and **Los Angeles** which is already listed (\#4). Additionally, **Dubai** is an emerging advertising hub in the Middle East using global talent, and **Warsaw** or **Warsaw** (Poland) has a growing game and design industry. However, the 20 cities above are the most *consistently active and revenue-generating* for illustration agencies.

Each of the top 20 cities has a slightly different industry mix driving illustration demand, but all share a common trait: they are centers of media, commerce, or culture where visual communication is crucial. They host the agencies, clients, or artist communities that ensure a high volume of commissioned illustration work. In these cities, one will find multiple **active illustration agencies, strong networks of freelance illustrators, and clients with budgets** for illustration – creating a self-sustaining ecosystem for the art form.

## **7\. Agent Pekka in Context – Comparison to Leading Agencies**

**Agent Pekka** is a boutique yet globally active illustration agency that originated in Finland. Comparing it to the larger agencies:

* **Size & Revenue:** Agent Pekka is **smaller in scale** than the giants like IllustrationX or The Bright Agency. It represents 36 artists internationally, whereas IllustrationX and Bright represent hundreds. While exact revenue for Agent Pekka isn’t public, given its roster size and boutique nature, it likely operates on an annual revenue in the low millions of USD (perhaps a few million at most in total project billings). In contrast, top agencies have revenues ranging from around $7–10M (Advocate’s range) up to $50M+ (IllustrationX, Bright) per year. So in pure revenue terms, Agent Pekka is a **mid-sized player** – not the largest, but certainly not the smallest either (many small agencies represent \<20 artists, so AP is a solid mid-size).

* **Market Positioning:** Agent Pekka positions itself as a **“global artist representation agency”** focused on **originality, creativity, and craftsmanship**. Its brand is abo ([Agent pekka Reviews 2025: Profile Details | GoodFirms](https://www.goodfirms.co/company/agent-pekka#:~:text=Agent%20Pekka%20is%20an%20illustration,diverse%20as%20they%20are%20distinctive)) *high-quality, trend-forward roster*\* – they are known for representing both established artists and rising new talent, all with distinctive styles. This is somewhat different from a mass-market agency. For example, Bright Agency (being very large) covers a broad swath of mainstream illustration needs (especially children’s media). Agent Pekka, by contras ([Advocate-Art: Revenue, Competitors, Alternatives](https://growjo.com/company/Advocate-Art#:~:text=%247.5M%20155%206,Company)) ed niche appeal\*; they represent artists known for cutting-edge illustration, contemporary graphic styles, and often interdisciplinary skills (some do 3D art, animation loops, installations, etc.). In the market, Agent Pekka is seen as a **boutique, premium agency** – clients may go to them when they specifically want something artistic and fresh. Leading agencies like IllustrationX also have diver ([Agent pekka Reviews 2025: Profile Details | GoodFirms](https://www.goodfirms.co/company/agent-pekka#:~:text=Agent%20Pekka%20is%20an%20illustration,diverse%20as%20they%20are%20distinctive)) their positioning is more all-encompassing (“one-stop-shop” for any style). Pekka’s smaller size allows for a more defined aesthetic and personal branding.

* **Geographic Reach:** Despite its Finnish roots, Agent Pekka is quite global. They have bases in **Amsterdam and Helsinki**, and even a presence in **Los Angeles**. This gives them access to European and North American markets. Many leading agencies are headquartered in London or New York with offices worldwide (IllustrationX has offices on multiple continents; Bright has London/NY; Advocate Art has UK/US/Spain, etc.). Agent Pekka’s rea ([Agent pekka Reviews 2025: Profile Details | GoodFirms](https://www.goodfirms.co/company/agent-pekka#:~:text=Agent%20Pekka%20is%20an%20illustration,picked%20roster%20includes)) e in that they work *globally*, but their physical team is small. Notably, Agent Pekka’s expansion to Amsterdam in 2012 was strategic: Amsterdam’s mix of international ad agencies and global brands was attractive. The co-founder noted Amsterdam’s appreciation for good design and presence of top agencies as reasons for setting up there. This move indicates Agent Pekka’s ambition to be in the same arenas as bigger players, just with a leaner team. In Helsinki (their home base), they are the top agency and have access to Scandinavian clien ([Agent pekka Reviews 2025: Profile Details | GoodFirms](https://www.goodfirms.co/company/agent-pekka#:~:text=,United%20States)) sign. So while Pekka can and does compete for projects worldwide, bigger agencies might have the advantage of larger sales teams and longer client lists in each region.

* **Unique Offerings:** Agent Pekka distinguishes itself by the range of creative services its artists can provide. They explicitly mention representing specialists in **3D illustration, animation, iconography, infographics, installations, pattern design, and typography**. This breadth, especially inclusion of installations and exp ([Finnish illustration brilliance goes Dutch as Agent Pekka sets up Amsterdam office](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/agent-pekka-amsterdam-show#:~:text=the%20best%20local%20Dutch%20talent,%E2%80%9D)) is a bit unusual for an illustration agency – it shows a forward-thinking approach, blurring lines between illustration, ar ([Finnish illustration brilliance goes Dutch as Agent Pekka sets up Amsterdam office](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/agent-pekka-amsterdam-show#:~:text=the%20best%20local%20Dutch%20talent,%E2%80%9D)) In comparison, a traditional illustration agency might focus on 2D illustration and maybe animation, but not necessarily installations or environmental design. Pekka’s roster includes artists like **Santtu Mustonen** (known for experimental 3D forms) and others with avant-garde styles. This gives them a **competitive edge in certain niches**: brands or projects looking for very modern, cutting-edge visuals may prefer Agent Pekka’s artists over a more generalist agency. They champion “newness” and have a “faultless eye for talent across styles,” as noted in a review of their Amsterdam launch exhibition.

* **Client Base & Projects:** Agent Pekka’s client ([Agent pekka Reviews 2025: Profile Details | GoodFirms](https://www.goodfirms.co/company/agent-pekka#:~:text=Agent%20Pekka%20is%20an%20illustration,diverse%20as%20they%20are%20distinctive)) from their artists’ portfolios) includes design-savvy brands and cultural institutions. They have done campaigns for tech companies, fashion brands, and editorial illustrations for trendsetting publications. Larger agencies handle a higher volume of bread-and-butter commercial jobs (e.g., Bright does hundreds of children’s book deals a year; IllustrationX covers everything from small editorial spots to Fortune 500 ad commissions). Agent Pekka likely handles fewer projects but often high-profil ([Finnish illustration brilliance goes Dutch as Agent Pekka sets up Amsterdam office](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/agent-pekka-amsterdam-show#:~:text=They%20have%20marked%20the%20move,a%20whole%20gamut%20of%20styles)) ivity ones. Their **competitive advantage** is the **boutique service** – with a small core team (they list 2–9 employees), they can offer **personalized attention** to both clients and artists. An art director working with Agent Pekka might directly speak with the founders/agents who deeply understand the style and fit ([Finnish illustration brilliance goes Dutch as Agent Pekka sets up Amsterdam office](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/agent-pekka-amsterdam-show#:~:text=They%20have%20marked%20the%20move,a%20whole%20gamut%20of%20styles)) r artists. This level of service can be a selling point versus a huge agency where a client might feel like “one of many.”

* **Revenue Model:** Like other agencies, Agent Pekka works on commission. With a smaller roster, each artist likely gets more focus to land jobs. If we compare revenue: IllustrationX’s \~$60M might correspond to thousands of commissions globally, whereas Agent Pekka’s revenue (perhaps a few million) comes from a more limited number of commissions where each may be of substantial creative value. For context, if an average illustration project through Agent Pekka is, say, $10k, and they take \~30%, they’d need hundreds of such projects to reach even $1M in commission income. ([Agent pekka Reviews 2025: Profile Details | GoodFirms](https://www.goodfirms.co/company/agent-pekka#:~:text=NA)) is to hit quality over quantity.

* **Reputation and Brand:** Among illustrators, Agent Pekka is well-regarded as a forward-looking agency. It was founded in 2007, which is relatively recent, yet it rose to prominence by about 2012 with that Amsterdam expansion and showcases. In comparisons, older agencies like CIA or Folio (est. decades ago) have long-standing industry relationships. Agent Pekka had to differentiate itself – which it did by being very **international (bridging Nordic talent with global clients)** and focusing on a *cool*, contemporary vibe. Their Instagram and promotions highlight stylish work, attracting clients who specifically *don’t* want the ordinary. As one article put it, Agent Pekka had a “killer reputation” even as it entered the central Europe market. This indicates that, qualitatively, Agent Pekka competes on the **basis of taste and trendsetting**.

* **Competition and Challenges:** When comparing to leading agencies, one challenge for Agent Pekka is scale – bigger agencies can attend more trade fairs, maintain bigger marketing budgets, and have agents on the ground in multiple countries constantly meeting clients. Agent Pekka’s smaller team must be very stra ([Finnish illustration brilliance goes Dutch as Agent Pekka sets up Amsterdam office](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/agent-pekka-amsterdam-show#:~:text=movement%20and%20assimilation%20leaving%20us,the%20heart%20of%20central%20Europe)) ng projects. However, being smaller also means they can adapt quickly to trends (e.g., pivoting to include digital animation, AR illustrations, or whatever new demand arises, without a huge corporate structure to shift). Another competitive factor now is the rise of AI imagery – all agencies are figuring out their stance. Agent Pekka’s emphasis on craftsmanship suggests they highlight human creativity as a selling point, which could be a plus when clients seek truly original art not easily replicated by AI. ([Finnish illustration brilliance goes Dutch as Agent Pekka sets up Amsterdam office](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/agent-pekka-amsterdam-show#:~:text=movement%20and%20assimilation%20leaving%20us,the%20heart%20of%20central%20Europe)) s are doing similarly, but Pekka’s curated approach might reassure clients of getting something unique.

In summary, **Agent Pekka holds its own by carving a niche**: It is **smaller and more specialized** than the big agencies, but operates globally and is respected for high-quality, innovative illustration work. Its revenue is lower than the mega-agencies, but it compensates with a strong brand identity and loyal relationships. Agent Pekka’s **competitive advantages** include its curated roster of distinctive artists, personalized service, and roots in the design-centric Nordic region (which can be a unique selling point). Compared to leading agencies, Agent Pekka is like a boutique firm versus a multinational firm – it may not compete on volume, but it competes on **creativity and originality**. As the illustration market grows, Agent Pekka’s approach positions it well to attract clients specifically looking for fresh visual solutions, complementing (rather than directly overtaking) what larger agencies offer.
