* **Marketing & Publicity Prowess:** Top agencies excel in **marketing themselves and their artists**. This includes **content marketing** (e.g., blogs, newsletters, case studies), **social media presence**, and proactive publicity. Many successful agencies create engaging content: Handsome Frank produces artist films ([Handsome Frank — Creatiview](https://creatiview.co.uk/morestories/handsomefrank#:~:text=match%20at%20L279%20work,inspirations%20and%20use%20these%20as)), Jacky Winter runs creative social campaigns and seasonal site art ([Eirian Chapman | Jacky Winter](https://www.jackywinter.com/artists/eirian-chapman#:~:text=Oct%2030%2C%2023%20Eirian%20Chapman,for%20Drunk%20Elephant)), etc. These efforts keep the agency in industry conversations and help attract incoming talent and projects. Being featured in industry rankings (like Creative Boom’s top agencies list ([20 best illustration agents in the UK, and the awesome illustrators they represent | Creative Boom](https://www.creativeboom.com/resources/20-best-illustration-agents-in-the-uk/#:~:text=3))) or winning awards adds to their marketing. **Publicity strategies** often involve highlighting successful collaborations – agencies will widely promote a big project to get coverage in art/design media. Additionally, participation in industry events, judging panels, or giving talks (e.g., Big Active sharing insights at design schools, or agency founders on podcasts) builds thought leadership. A notable success factor is how agencies leverage **digital channels**: Instagram, Behance, LinkedIn are common platforms to showcase new work and behind-the-scenes peeks, which keeps their audience engaged. Agencies that interact with their followers, celebrate their artists’ wins, and maintain consistent outreach tend to have stronger brand recall. Essentially, successful agencies market themselves almost as diligently as they market their artists – ensuring a steady stream of visibility.
