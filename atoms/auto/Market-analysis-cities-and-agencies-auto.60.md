The **top agencies by revenue globally** would include IllustrationX, Bright, B\&A, and possibly a few others in the $10M+ annual billing range (many of those are headquartered in either New York or London). Mid-sized agencies often operate in the $1–5M range with smaller staff but sometimes equally prestigious artist rosters. The agency field is competitive; agencies differentiate themselves by the **talent they curate, the industries they serve, and their geographic reach**. For example, Bright and Advocate excel in publishing and licensing, B\&A in high-end advertising, while an agency like **Agent Pekka** has a unique blend of avant-garde artists attracting design-focused clients.
