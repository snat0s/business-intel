**j. Focus on Storytelling and Visual Narrative Expertise:** One of Agent Pekka’s specialties is “visual storytelling.” It can double down on this as a unique selling point, essentially branding itself not just as an illustration vendor but as an **expert in storytelling through imagery**. This means in pitches and marketing, emphasize how Agent Pekka helps brands *tell their story and engage audiences through bespoke visuals*. Perhaps develop a tagline or case study series around stories (e.g., “Story Behind the Art: how our illustration boosted Brand X’s engagement by Y%”). This plays to a current need in content marketing – many brands have plenty of data but need help humanizing and visualizing their narratives. If Agent Pekka positions as the agency that doesn’t just deliver a pretty image, but consults on how that image fits the brand narrative or campaign storyline, it adds strategic value. This could justify premium pricing and deepen client relationships (moving from vendor to partner). Training or encouraging its artists to think in narrative terms (sequential art, campaigns, not just one-off images) and showcasing those capabilities can substantiate this positioning. Over time, Agent Pekka could become known as the boutique agency that **“makes your brand story come alive visually,”** which differentiates it from competitors who might focus more on the art itself rather than the communication goal.
