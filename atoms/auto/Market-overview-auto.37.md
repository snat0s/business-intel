* **Adaptability and Trend Adoption:** The creative industry is always evolving (new styles, technologies, media platforms). Successful agencies tend to be those who **adapt to trends and even help set them**. For example, as demand for digital content grew, many illustration agencies started offering animation and GIF capabilities – those that did (like Jacky Winter adding GIF artists, or ATRBUTE and Making Pictures including CGI/animation early) positioned themselves ahead. Embracing social media as a portfolio (Instagram) was another adaptation, which agencies like Jacky Winter and HF did effectively, whereas some traditional agencies were slower. Agencies that spot emerging trends – say, AR/VR illustration, NFT art, or illustrated content for new platforms – and incorporate them (through specialist hires or partnerships) can capture new markets. ATRBUTE’s creation of “Labs” to explore new media is a clear example of proactive adaptability ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/contact#:~:text=,their%20work%20with%20iconic%20brands)). In sum, **staying ahead of the curve** in terms of creative trends and client needs is a success factor: it ensures the agency’s offerings remain relevant and that it can capture high-growth areas before competitors.
