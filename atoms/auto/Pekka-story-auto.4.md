I’d love to help with this\! Could you provide some background on how Agent Pekka was founded, key milestones, and any pivotal moments in its history? Also, what aspects of the current company would you like to emphasize—its values, business model, global reach, or something else? Lastly, do you have any preferred tone or storytelling style (e.g., documentary-style, narrative-driven, business case study)?
