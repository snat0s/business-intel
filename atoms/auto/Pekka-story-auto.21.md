Building on this momentum, Agent Pekka embarked on physical expansion. In May 2012, the company opened its first office outside of Helsinki – choosing Amsterdam as its gateway to continental Europe ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=Agent%20Pekka%2C%20the%20Helsinki,in%20the%20heart%20of%20Amsterdam)). Co-founder Pablo Steffa explained that Amsterdam was a natural choice due to “the interesting mix of international and local advertising agencies, the presence of strong global brands and the appreciation the Dutch have for good design” in that city ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=Pablo%20Steffa%2C%20co,will%20inspire%20the%20local%20creatives)). The Amsterdam office launch was marked by a group exhibition titled **“PEKKA IS HERE”** at the Guns & Butter Gallery, featuring works by 25 of the agency’s illustrators from various countries ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=Amsterdam,in%20the%20heart%20of%20Amsterdam)) ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=The%20exhibition%20at%20GUNS%20%26,Antti%20Uotila%20and%20Holly%20Wales)). This event not only celebrated the expansion but also physically showcased Agent Pekka’s diverse talent pool to the European creative community. Heading the new Amsterdam office was Caroline Svensson, an experienced art producer from the local advertising scene, whose recruitment was key to establishing Agent Pekka’s presence in the Netherlands ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=brands%20and%20the%20appreciation%20the,will%20inspire%20the%20local%20creatives)). The successful setup in Amsterdam solidified Agent Pekka’s *“killer reputation”* in the heart of Europe ([Finnish illustration brilliance goes Dutch as Agent Pekka sets up Amsterdam office](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/agent-pekka-amsterdam-show#:~:text=movement%20and%20assimilation%20leaving%20us,the%20heart%20of%20central%20Europe)), making it easier to liaise with European clients and artists.
