* **Revenue Model:** Like other agencies, Agent Pekka works on commission. With a smaller roster, each artist likely gets more focus to land jobs. If we compare revenue: IllustrationX’s \~$60M might correspond to thousands of commissions globally, whereas Agent Pekka’s revenue (perhaps a few million) comes from a more limited number of commissions where each may be of substantial creative value. For context, if an average illustration project through Agent Pekka is, say, $10k, and they take \~30%, they’d need hundreds of such projects to reach even $1M in commission income. ([Agent pekka Reviews 2025: Profile Details | GoodFirms](https://www.goodfirms.co/company/agent-pekka#:~:text=NA)) is to hit quality over quantity.
