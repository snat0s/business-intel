**Europe** – Europe is another major region, with the U.K. in particular recognized as a global hub for illustration talent and agencies (London is home to many top agencies and publishing firms). Across Europe, illustration is in high demand for advertising campaigns, magazines, product packaging, and the region’s strong children’s book publishing market. While a precise regional dollar figure is hard to pin down, Europe’s share of the global market is significant – likely on par with North America in many segments. For example, the concentration of illustration agencies in the U.K. and continental Europe suggests several billions of dollars of activity in commissioned illustration flow through European markets annually (proportional to the global agency market).
