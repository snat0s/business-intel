**c. Attract Top-Tier Artists with Boutique Attention:** To grow the roster’s star power, Agent Pekka can aim to **sign one or two high-profile illustrators or digital artists** who are free agents or unhappy at larger agencies. The pitch to them: Agent Pekka offers *more personalized management and a focused push* (something that might get lost at a huge agency). Many artists value the close relationship and support an agency provides; Agent Pekka can double down on its human, artist-friendly approach. For instance, it can showcase how its current artists benefit – maybe through testimonials or case studies of how Agent Pekka helped boost a particular artist’s career or licensing deals. Additionally, continuing to scout and invest in **emerging talent** (perhaps through an open submissions initiative or competitions) can add fresh stars to the roster before they’re scooped by competitors. Once a couple of big-name artists are onboard (even if not exclusive, but for certain regions), Agent Pekka can gain more client attention – big brands often follow where big artists go. It’s a virtuous cycle: better artists lead to better projects. Thus, prioritizing talent acquisition/retention with promises of **quality projects, global exposure, and caring management** is crucial.
