Today, Agent Pekka stands as a **global artist representation agency** with a presence on multiple continents. Its business model remains that of a creative consultancy and talent agency: it connects its roster of artists with clients who need compelling visual content, and facilitates their collaborations from start to finish ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=Established%20in%202007%2C%20Agent%20Pekka,Sony%2C%20Warner%20Music%2C%20and%20Nike)). In practical terms, Agent Pekka negotiates projects on behalf of its artists – handling client briefs, contracts, and project management – while taking a commission fee for the work secured. This model allows brands and advertising agencies to easily tap into a pool of pre-vetted, top-tier creative talent, and allows artists to focus on creation rather than business logistics.
