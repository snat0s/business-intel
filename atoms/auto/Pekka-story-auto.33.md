In terms of **international reach**, Agent Pekka truly lives up to its “global” description. The company is headquartered in Helsinki and maintains offices in Amsterdam and Los Angeles (with past operations in New York as well) ([Agent Pekka — Violaine & Jérémy](https://www.violaineetjeremy.fr/project/agent-pekka#:~:text=Complete%20rebranding%20of%20Agent%20Pekka%27s,%E2%9C%BA)) ([Agent Pekka (@agentpekka) • Instagram photos and videos](https://www.instagram.com/agentpekka/#:~:text=We%27re%20a%20global%20collaboration%20agency,Amsterdam%20and%20work%20everywhere)). It deliberately planted these bases in creative capitals to stay close to major markets. However, the agency works across all regions – it has facilitated collaborations for clients in Europe, North America, Asia and beyond. Communications and portfolio showings are often done virtually or via traveling portfolio events (a practice they embraced early on), meaning distance is not a barrier. The current roster features artists from dozens of nationalities, indicating that Agent Pekka is not seen as just a “Finnish” agency anymore, but rather an international collective. Likewise, the clientele list includes companies from around the world; Agent Pekka’s artists have created illustrations for French fashion houses, American tech companies, Japanese retailers, and everything in between ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=Brands%20include%3A%C2%A0Absolut%20Vodka%2C%20Adidas%2C%20Adobe%2C,Toyota%2C%20Vogue%20Eyewear%20and%20Volkswagen)). Being multilingual and culturally adaptive has become second nature to the agency.
