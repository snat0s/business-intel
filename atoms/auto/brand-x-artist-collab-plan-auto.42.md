* **Adidas x Kanye West “Yeezy” (2013–2022)** – *Artist-Led Sneaker Empire*: While Kanye West is primarily known as a musician, in this collaboration he acted as a creative designer – making it relevant to consider alongside visual artist deals. Adidas gave West what was described as an **“unprecedented \[licensing\] deal”** ([Kanye's Yeezy is a Multi-Billion Dollar Business and Still Growing](https://www.thefashionlaw.com/kanye-wests-yeezy-venture-is-worth-1-billion-and-growing/#:~:text=appears%20to%20be%20an%20unprecedented,from%20his%20partnership%20with%20Nike)). West retained ownership of the Yeezy brand and designs, and Adidas produced and distributed the sneakers. In return, Kanye received roughly **15% royalties on wholesale revenue** (far higher than the single-digit royalties athletes or artists usually get), plus an additional marketing fee ([Kanye's Yeezy is a Multi-Billion Dollar Business and Still Growing](https://www.thefashionlaw.com/kanye-wests-yeezy-venture-is-worth-1-billion-and-growing/#:~:text=appears%20to%20be%20an%20unprecedented,from%20his%20partnership%20with%20Nike)). This generous revenue-sharing was justified by West’s central role in design and promotion. The results were staggering: Yeezy sales were projected to hit **$1.5 billion in 2019** alone ([Kanye's Yeezy is a Multi-Billion Dollar Business and Still Growing](https://www.thefashionlaw.com/kanye-wests-yeezy-venture-is-worth-1-billion-and-growing/#:~:text=Fast%20forward%20five%20years%20from,%E2%80%9Cstill%20growing%2C%E2%80%9D%20according%20to%20Forbes)), implying roughly **$225 million** in earnings to West that year from royalties. In fact, West’s cut from Yeezy sneakers in 2019 was **greater than Michael Jordan’s from Nike** (Jordan earns \~5% royalty) ([Forbes \- Kanye’s Second Coming: Inside The Billion-Dollar Yeezy Empire : r/hiphopheads](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/cb12eo/forbes_kanyes_second_coming_inside_the/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2)). This partnership turned West into a billionaire and was hailed by Adidas as “the most significant partnership ever with a non-athlete” ([Adidas expands Kanye West partnership with branded stores](https://www.retaildive.com/news/adidas-expands-kanye-west-partnership-with-branded-stores/421786/#:~:text=Adidas%20expands%20Kanye%20West%20partnership,athlete%20and%20an%20athletic%20brand.%E2%80%9D)). It exemplifies how an artist-designer can negotiate equity-like stakes (ownership of IP and high profit share) when their brand is essential to the product’s appeal.
