**8\. Berlin (Germany):** *Creative Hotbed in Central Europe.* Berlin has become a magnet for creatives, including illustrators, and has a supportive art scene. Germany’s advertising industry is substantial (with many agencies in Hamburg, Munich, as well as Berlin), and Germany is one of Europe’s largest publishing markets (educational and trade publishing). Berlin edges out other German cities in this list due to its concentration of artists and new media companies. **Industries:** Advertising (especially edgy campaigns aimed at youth culture, since Berlin brands itself as young and hip), **media and publishing** (Berlin has many magazines, startups, and tech companies that love using cool illustrations on their websites and marketing). Also, Berlin hosts many **illustration events and conferences**, reinforcing its role as an industry hub. For instance, the Illustrative art festival in Berlin draws international attention. *Notable agencies:* **2Agenten** (a well-known Berlin illustration agency representing contemporary illustrators), **Jute Illustratoren** (an agency/collective), and **SEUFFERT** (Berlin-based rep for illustrators). Additionally, some UK agencies have German representation to service clients in Berlin and beyond. Berlin’s attractiveness to freelance illustrators (due to relatively lower living costs and artsy environment) means many illustrators live there and take international commissions – some through agencies. According to one ranking, Berlin is considered the **\#1 “artist-friendly” city** globally, which indicates the level of creative activity. The city’s illustration market revenue comes from both local commissions (e.g., a German publisher hiring a Berlin illustrator) and work that Berlin-based artists do for clients elsewhere (sometimes via their agents in London/NY). In sum, Berlin plays a pivotal role in the European illustration ecosystem and continues to grow as a creative capital.
