In terms of broadening, Agent Pekka may explore new realms of visual arts and technology as they become relevant. The agency has already embraced fields like 3D illustration and animation; going forward, areas such as augmented reality (AR) art, virtual reality experiences, or interactive illustration could become part of their repertoire as client needs evolve. Their founders’ backgrounds in tech and design hint that Agent Pekka is not afraid to innovate. As the lines between design, art, and technology blur (for example, illustrators now working on VR environments or NFT art, etc.), Agent Pekka is well positioned to represent artists in these hybrid domains, staying true to its ethos of quality and creativity but applying it in new ways.
