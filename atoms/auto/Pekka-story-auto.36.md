Agent Pekka’s influence on the art and illustration representation market has been significant, particularly in its home country and increasingly internationally. In Finland, Agent Pekka essentially **pioneered the modern illustration agency model**. Before 2007, the idea of an agency for illustrators was virtually non-existent in Finland ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=Parikka%20heittiv%C3%A4t%20h%C3%A4nelle%20reilut%20nelj%C3%A4,toiminta%C2%ADmallia%20ei%20aikaisemmin%20ole%20ollut)). By establishing a successful agency, Agent Pekka set a precedent that illustration is a viable export and that artists can benefit from professional representation. This has helped elevate the status of illustrators in Finland from behind-the-scenes freelancers to recognized creative professionals with international careers. It also opened the door for other representation firms and encouraged organizations to support creatives in new ways. The fact that Finnish illustration began gaining worldwide attention in the late 2000s is often credited in part to Agent Pekka’s activities – as noted, *“the influence of Agent Pekka on the world conquest of Finnish illustration cannot be ignored.”* ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=teht%C3%A4v%C3%A4kseen%20kollegojen%20osaamisen%20markkinoinnin%20ja,his%20colleagues%E2%80%99%20expertise%20his%20task)) Finnish illustrators started appearing in global advertising, publications, and art shows, building the Finland design brand abroad.
