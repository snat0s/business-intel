**a. Differentiate with a Clear Brand Niche:** Agent Pekka should sharpen and promote its unique identity. Currently known for “championing originality, creativity and craftsmanship” in illustration and design ([Agent pekka Reviews 2025: Profile Details | GoodFirms](https://www.goodfirms.co/company/agent-pekka#:~:text=We%27re%20a%20global%20artist%20representation,agency)), this ethos can be made Agent Pekka’s signature in the global market. For example, Agent Pekka could position itself as **the go-to agency for Nordic and innovative design sensibilities** – leveraging its Scandinavian roots (Helsinki) as a mark of quality, quirky humor, and clean design. This storytelling (perhaps emphasizing Finnish design heritage married with global trends) can set it apart from London or NY-based agencies. By highlighting any unique roster strengths – say, if many of its artists have a distinct illustrative style (minimalist, whimsical, etc.) or expertise in areas like iconography and infographics (which Agent Pekka mentions ([Agent pekka Reviews 2025: Profile Details | GoodFirms](https://www.goodfirms.co/company/agent-pekka#:~:text=Agent%20Pekka%20is%20an%20illustration,diverse%20as%20they%20are%20distinctive))) – Agent Pekka can carve out a **marketable niche**. In practical terms: refine the branding on its website and materials to tell *Agent Pekka’s story* (origin, philosophy) compellingly, so clients remember what’s special about it. Emphasize terms like “a human agency” (as per its Instagram tagline) and the hand-crafted quality of its artists’ work to appeal to clients seeking authenticity in a digital world.
