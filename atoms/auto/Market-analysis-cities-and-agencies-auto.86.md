* **Size & Revenue:** Agent Pekka is **smaller in scale** than the giants like IllustrationX or The Bright Agency. It represents 36 artists internationally, whereas IllustrationX and Bright represent hundreds. While exact revenue for Agent Pekka isn’t public, given its roster size and boutique nature, it likely operates on an annual revenue in the low millions of USD (perhaps a few million at most in total project billings). In contrast, top agencies have revenues ranging from around $7–10M (Advocate’s range) up to $50M+ (IllustrationX, Bright) per year. So in pure revenue terms, Agent Pekka is a **mid-sized player** – not the largest, but certainly not the smallest either (many small agencies represent \<20 artists, so AP is a solid mid-size).
