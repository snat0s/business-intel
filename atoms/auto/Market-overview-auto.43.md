**b. Expand Global Presence & Outreach:** To compete with firms that have offices in multiple regions, Agent Pekka has already made progress (with a Los Angeles contact and its bases in Europe) ([Agent pekka Reviews 2025: Profile Details | GoodFirms](https://www.goodfirms.co/company/agent-pekka#:~:text=,United%20States)). It should continue expanding its **global reach**. This could involve: establishing a stronger presence in the **US (e.g., a rep or small office in New York)** to tap the large North American market, and exploring representation partnerships in **Asia-Pacific** (given Asia’s high growth ([Illustration Agency Service Market Research Report 2032](https://dataintelo.com/report/illustration-agency-service-market#:~:text=Regionally%2C%20North%20America%20and%20Europe,lucrative%20opportunities%20for%20service%20providers))). Even without physical offices, Agent Pekka can assign dedicated agents to key regions or collaborate with local agencies on cross-representation. Targeting APAC could be fruitful – e.g., attending or sponsoring industry events in Singapore, Shanghai or Tokyo, to network with clients there. Also, leverage existing global client relationships to get referrals in new geographies. The goal is to make Agent Pekka *perceived as a global player* despite its smaller size. Being able to say “we work globally with artists/clients across Europe, America, and Asia” and having some marquee projects in each region (perhaps secured by proactive pitches to clients in those regions) will elevate its status.
