### Step 2: Assess Current Assets and Create New Series
- **Artist Back Catalogues**:
  - Inventory licensable works from 50 artists (approximately 20 pieces each, totaling 1,000 pieces initially).
  - Review existing artist contracts to confirm licensing rights or negotiate amendments as needed.
- **New Series Creation**:
  - Commission artists to develop themed collections (e.g., seasonal, brand-specific, or culturally relevant series) tailored to attract licensees, especially in new markets like China.
  - Target 2–3 new series in Year 1, each with 10–15 pieces, adding 30–45 new licensable works annually.
