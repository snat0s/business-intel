* **High-Quality Artist Roster:** The foundation of success is a **strong network of talented artists**. Top agencies carefully curate their rosters to include either widely recognized artists or exceptional new voices (and often a mix). For example, Handsome Frank’s reputation was built by hand-picking some of “the world’s finest contemporary illustrators” and standing out with quality ([About • Handsome Frank • Home to the world's greatest illustrators](https://www.handsomefrank.com/about#:~:text=A%20decade%20later%20Handsome%20Frank,creative%20agencies%20in%20the%20world)). Agencies that represent artists with **distinctive styles and professional reliability** attract high-profile clients. The roster should align with market demand – whether broad (B\&A’s multi-discipline roster ([Trunk Archive secures second major acquisition \- Gallery Stock and Bernstein & Andriulli \- Photoarchivenews](https://photoarchivenews.com/news/trunk-archive-secures-second-major-acquisition-gallery-stock-and-bernstein-andriulli/#:~:text=bespoke%20commercial%20and%20museum%20partner,so%20pleased%20to%20be%20joining))) or niche (Big Active’s edgy image-makers ([20 best illustration agents in the UK, and the awesome illustrators they represent | Creative Boom](https://www.creativeboom.com/resources/20-best-illustration-agents-in-the-uk/#:~:text=Headquartered%20in%20London%2C%20Big%20Active,and%203D%20artist%20Jack%20Sachs))) – and consistently deliver top-notch work. In short, **talent is the currency** of these agencies: those who sign and nurture the best talent gain a competitive edge.
