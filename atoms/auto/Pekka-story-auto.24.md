Throughout its journey, Agent Pekka encountered both challenges and successes, each shaping the agency’s character and strategy. In the early days, a primary challenge was **pioneering a new business model in Finland**. Convincing Finnish illustrators and clients to trust an agency for representation required education and proof of concept. Many artists had never had an agent, and many local clients were used to hiring illustrators directly. Agent Pekka addressed this by demonstrating tangible benefits: they made it easier for clients (especially foreign ones) to discover Finnish talent, and they handled the business side (contracts, negotiations) so that artists could focus on art. Over time, skepticism gave way to appreciation as illustrators saw their international commissions grow through the agency’s efforts. The strong professional support and marketing expertise that Agent Pekka provided were new to the Finnish scene, and they indeed “instilled a new culture” where illustrators began to see representation as an asset ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=teht%C3%A4v%C3%A4kseen%20kollegojen%20osaamisen%20markkinoinnin%20ja,his%20colleagues%E2%80%99%20expertise%20his%20task)).
