Got it\! I will research financial models and real data on earnings from brand x visual artist collaborations, such as when an artist designs a product (e.g., sneakers for Adidas). I’ll gather information on licensing deals, royalties, lump-sum payments, and revenue-sharing models, along with case studies and reported financial figures where available.
