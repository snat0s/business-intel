Agent Pekka quickly gained traction in the Finnish market and just as quickly started attracting attention abroad. The unique styles of its illustrators and the fresh concept of a Finnish illustration agency drew interest from international clients and even artists outside Finland. Within just a few years, Agent Pekka’s reputation for “well-crafted and unique illustration” made it a sought-after representative not only for Finnish creatives but for talent globally ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20dedicated%20to%203D%2C%20animation%2C,diverse%20as%20they%20are%20distinctive)). What began as a local initiative evolved rapidly – foreign illustrators began reaching out, eager to join the curated roster. This was a notable development: an agency founded to export Finnish art soon found itself *importing* international artists onto its team.
