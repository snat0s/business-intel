**6\. Shanghai (China):** *Emerging Giant in Advertising Illustration.* Shanghai is one of Asia’s largest commercial hubs and has a rapidly growing creative sector. Multinational advertising agencies and big Chinese brands (Alibaba, Tencent, etc.) have major operations in Shanghai, and they increasingly commission custom illustrations for campaigns (especially to stand out in digital marketing and product packaging). The city is also known for its vibrant design scene blending Eastern and Western influences. **Industries:** Advertising (consumer electronics, luxury goods targeting China’s market, e-commerce visuals), **gaming** (Shanghai hosts game companies and animation studios that need concept art and promotional art), and corporate marketing (illustrations for fintech, technology, and real estate marketing are common). While the concept of independent illustration agencies is relatively new in China, it’s developing. Some agencies from abroad have set up in Shanghai or partner with locals – for instance, **Caper Illustration** works out of London and Shanghai to connect Asian artists with global projects. We also see local agencies like **G illustration** or **IllusMania** popping up. *Notable agencies:* **Shanghai Untitled** (a creative agency representing illustrators), **Caper Shanghai** (mentioned above), and **Neocha** (a creative agency in Shanghai that works with illustrators and artists). Moreover, IllustrationX and other global reps have China-focused agents (IllustrationX has an agent fluent in Chinese based in Asia). Shanghai’s inclusion in the top 10 reflects China’s enormous consumer market – even a small fraction of ad budgets going to illustration translates to substantial revenue. As of the late 2010s ([Caper Illustration (@caper.illustration) • Instagram photos and videos](https://www.instagram.com/caper.illustration/?hl=en#:~:text=Caper%20Illustration%20%28%40caper,Asia%20through%20illustration%20and%20animation)) e 2020s, Shanghai is a city where East meets West in illustration, with increasing opportunities for agencies to broker deals for both local and international talent.
