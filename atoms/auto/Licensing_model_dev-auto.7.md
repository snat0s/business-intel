### Step 4: Build the Licensing Platform

- **Future SaaS Platform (2026)**:
  - Develop a comprehensive SaaS solution to automate bulk licensing, supporting exponential growth in low-end licenses.
- **Global Considerations**:
  - Design the platform to support multiple languages (starting with French and Mandarin) and currencies to serve Paris, Shanghai, and beyond.
