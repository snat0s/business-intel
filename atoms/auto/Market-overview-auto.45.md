**d. Showcase Client Successes and Expand Client Base:** Agent Pekka should make its **client portfolio more visible and impressive**. If it has done work for notable brands (even regionally notable European brands or design-forward companies), those names and logos should be front-and-center on marketing materials (as competitors do). This provides social proof. Additionally, proactively seek out collaborations with a few high-profile clients to create flagship case studies. For instance, pitching a project to a known tech company or fashion brand (maybe leveraging the Amsterdam base for European brands like Adidas, Heineken, etc., or Helsinki connections for gaming/tech companies in Scandinavia like Supercell, Rovio) and delivering a standout campaign would give material to promote. **High-profile brand collaborations** not only bring revenue but also significantly elevate Agent Pekka’s profile; thus, investing resources in landing such accounts (perhaps offering first-project incentives or doing speculative proposals) can be strategic. Once achieved, publish detailed case studies: e.g., “Agent Pekka artists reimagined X brand’s campaign – here’s the result” with visuals and client quotes. Over time, broaden the client base geographically and sector-wise: if strong in Europe advertising, try to break into US publishing, or Asian tech, etc., to diversify and reduce reliance on any single market.
