* **Latin America:** Latin America’s illustration market is smaller in global comparison but still notable. **Brazil** is the standout – its advertising industry (São Paulo is a major ad market) and its large media sector drive demand for illustration in ads, magazines, and textbooks. Countries like **Mexico** (the largest Spanish-speaking advertising market, centered in Mexico City) and **Argentina** have active creative industries that employ illustrators. Latin America might account for a single-digit percentage of the global market, but cities like São Paulo, Mexico City, and Buenos Aires have established agencies and artists serving both local and international clients. For instance, Brazil has agencies such as **Norte** and **Gera** Illustration Agency catering to big brands (clients like Bridgestone, Red Bull, etc.).
