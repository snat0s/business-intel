* **Coach x Jean-Michel Basquiat (2020)** – *Artistry in Contemporary Fashion*: The estate of Basquiat has partnered with many brands, but a standout was Coach’s 2020 collection which prominently featured Basquiat’s imagery on jackets, bags, and shirts. This was part of Coach’s runway show and marketing that year. The deal was a **licensing collaboration via the Basquiat Estate’s agents**. Coach likely paid a hefty licensing fee and/or royalties to use several of Basquiat’s iconic paintings across its product line. The collection garnered a lot of press and brought a younger, art-conscious audience to Coach. While specific sales weren’t public, Basquiat’s estate earnings give a clue: the estate’s licensing income peaked at **$10.7 million in 2019** (around the time these fashion deals proliferated) ([Basquiat, Inc.: How the Artist’s Estate Built a Licensing Empire of Branded Barbies, Dog Hoodies, Coach Backpacks, and More](https://news.artnet.com/market/jean-michel-basquiat-inc-licensing-empire-2100008#:~:text=estates%2C%20and%20big%20brands,7%20million%20in%202019)). This indicates that such collaborations have become a multi-million-dollar revenue stream for the estate. The Coach x Basquiat case also exemplifies a *best-of-both-worlds* outcome: Coach gained cultural relevance, and the artist’s legacy reached new consumers while the estate reaped financial rewards.
