* **United States:** The U.S. is one of the largest single markets for illustration. The illustration industry in the U.S. was valued around **$3.5 billion** as of 2023, with steady growth (\~4% annually expected) driven by high demand for visual content in advertising, p ([Illustration Business Plan Template & Example \- PlanPros](https://planpros.ai/business-plan-examples/business-services/illustration-business-plan-template/#:~:text=The%20Illustration%20industry%20in%20the,Trends%20towards%20digital)) and digital media. The robust U.S. advertising industry (over $300 billion/year in ad spend) and the large publishing sector contribute heavily to this figure. Illustrations appear in everything from national ad campaigns to book illustrations and editorial pieces, adding up to a multi-billion dollar domestic market.
