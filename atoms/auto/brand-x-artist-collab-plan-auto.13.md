* **High-Profile Collaborations:**  
  * **Adidas & Kanye West (Yeezy):** While the exact numbers are closely held, the overall deal reportedly involved a multi-million-dollar upfront component plus royalties that contribute to an ongoing stream of revenue. The success of Yeezy sneakers shows how a superstar collaboration can be structured for long-term profitability.  
* **Other Notable Collaborations:**  
  * **Nike & Artists/Designers:** Similar structures exist where established artists or designers receive a combination of fees, royalties, and performance incentives.  
  * **Limited Edition Drops:** Many collaborations—sometimes involving lesser-known artists—are set up as limited runs. In these cases, higher margins on exclusivity can mean the artist’s royalty percentage (or bonus) results in a significant payout relative to the scale of the release.
