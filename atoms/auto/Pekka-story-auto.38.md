Moreover, Agent Pekka’s expansion to multiple continents hinted at a shift in the market: talent representation in the creative field was no longer tied to one city or country. Following their lead, it became more common to see agencies (and artists) operate without borders, using international agents or opening satellite offices to reach clients everywhere. The agency’s ability to secure prominent campaigns (like the earlier-mentioned Nokia UK project, or later projects for brands like **Absolut Vodka or Adidas**) helped illustrate the value that specialized illustration agencies add to advertising and design projects ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=Established%20in%202007%2C%20Agent%20Pekka,Sony%2C%20Warner%20Music%2C%20and%20Nike)). Their artists have contributed to award-winning advertisements and high-visibility media, indirectly influencing visual trends (for example, some of Agent Pekka’s illustrators have very recognizable styles that have set design trends in advertising and editorial design worldwide).
