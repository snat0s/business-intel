Geographically, while Agent Pekka already “works everywhere,” the future might see even greater global engagement. We might anticipate stronger ties in regions like East Asia or Latin America, where illustration and design markets are growing – perhaps through partnerships or increased travel and participation in events (similar to how they attended trade fairs in the early days). The agency’s collaborative model could also expand; for instance, Agent Pekka might facilitate more collaborations between its artists and clients in the form of creative labs, residencies, or cross-disciplinary projects, further solidifying its role as a connector in the industry.
