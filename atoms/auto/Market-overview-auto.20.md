* **Artist Network:** Big Active is a London-headquartered creative consultancy that specializes in both **art direction/design and artist representation** ([20 best illustration agents in the UK, and the awesome illustrators they represent | Creative Boom](https://www.creativeboom.com/resources/20-best-illustration-agents-in-the-uk/#:~:text=Headquartered%20in%20London%2C%20Big%20Active,and%203D%20artist%20Jack%20Sachs)). Its artist network features **“leading image-makers”** across disciplines like illustration, graphic design, and moving image. Notably, Big Active represents celebrated creatives such as **Mat Maitland** (known for surreal collage art direction in fashion/music), **Anthony Burrill** (a prominent graphic artist), **Kate Gibb** (renowned printmaker), **Joe Cruz** (illustrator), and **Jack Sachs** (3D illustrator/animator) ([20 best illustration agents in the UK, and the awesome illustrators they represent | Creative Boom](https://www.creativeboom.com/resources/20-best-illustration-agents-in-the-uk/#:~:text=Headquartered%20in%20London%2C%20Big%20Active,and%203D%20artist%20Jack%20Sachs)). This roster indicates a **focus on artists with a bold, trendsetting style**. The network is not huge but is well-respected; many of their artists have significant followings and award-winning work (Big Active itself has won D\&AD awards, partly due to the strength of its talent) ([20 best illustration agents in the UK, and the awesome illustrators ...](https://www.creativeboom.com/resources/20-best-illustration-agents-in-the-uk/#:~:text=20%20best%20illustration%20agents%20in,specialisation%20include%20art%20direction%2C)). The strength here is the **caliber and innovation** of the artists – Big Active’s talent pool is often at the cutting edge of visual culture, especially in music and fashion-related illustration. A possible weakness is that the roster might skew toward a particular aesthetic (edgy, high-concept work), which could be less appealing for more conservative clients; however, this is also what differentiates Big Active from more generalist agencies.  
* **Client Portfolio & Collaborations:** Big Active has a rich history of collaborations, especially in the **music and entertainment industry** and with **fashion/lifestyle brands**. Historically, Big Active made its name designing album covers and visuals for musicians – for example, they’ve worked on artwork for bands and artists (The agency was behind iconic album designs in the 2000s). Their represented artists have worked with clients like **Dries Van Noten (high fashion)** – e.g., Big Active’s illustrator Robert Beatty was commissioned by the fashion house for runway show visuals ([Future Selves: BIG ACTIVE | Illustration L5](https://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/sophieleary/2020/02/08/future-selves-big-active/#:~:text=)) – and various record labels (one of their strengths is marrying music with visual art). They also handle advertising and content creation for brands; recent team-ups mentioned include projects with companies like **Kiehl’s, Selfridges, The Guardian, FT Weekend Magazine** (via a partner agency listing) ([20 best illustration agents in the UK, and the awesome illustrators they represent | Creative Boom](https://www.creativeboom.com/resources/20-best-illustration-agents-in-the-uk/#:~:text=Founded%20by%20Olivia%20Triggs%20in,Andy%20Gilmour%20and%20Paula%20Castro)). As a consultancy, Big Active often provides creative direction plus the artwork, meaning clients entrust them with the whole look and feel of a campaign or product imagery. Their client portfolio is **boutique but high-profile**, aligning with design-forward brands and media. This is a strength because it cements Big Active’s reputation in trendy sectors. On the flip side, Big Active might not be the go-to for, say, massive mainstream ad campaigns outside of those niches, which can be seen as a slight limitation in market breadth – but they appear content focusing on areas where they excel.  
* **Brand Image & Public Perception:** Big Active is seen as a **cutting-edge creative powerhouse**. Within the design and illustration community, it has an image of being *artistic, innovative, and a bit edgy*. The fact that it’s **D\&AD award-winning** and known for high-quality art direction lends it an aura of prestige ([20 best illustration agents in the UK, and the awesome illustrators ...](https://www.creativeboom.com/resources/20-best-illustration-agents-in-the-uk/#:~:text=20%20best%20illustration%20agents%20in,specialisation%20include%20art%20direction%2C)). Publicly, Big Active isn’t as widely known as some larger agencies, partly because it operates more like a creative studio/consultancy. However, among industry insiders (art directors, brand managers in fashion/music), it has a strong reputation. It’s often associated with visually striking, adventurous work. Big Active markets itself as a consultancy that **“curates and manages leading talent”** and produces inspiring content, which gives it a dual identity: part artist agency, part creative production house ([Future Selves: BIG ACTIVE | Illustration L5 \- University of Brighton](https://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/sophieleary/2020/02/08/future-selves-big-active/#:~:text=Future%20Selves%3A%20BIG%20ACTIVE%20,eye%20opener%20into%20the%20business)). This blended brand image is a bit similar to Hugo & Marie’s model, but Big Active has been around longer (they were established in the 1990s) and have a UK-centric legacy in graphic design. The public perception is that if you want something avant-garde or stylistically bold, Big Active is a top choice. Their brand is also tied to music culture (having worked with many musicians), giving them a cool cachet. There aren’t obvious weaknesses in image aside from being niche – which they likely view as a strength since it differentiates them.  
* **Revenue & Profitability:** Big Active is private and on the smaller side (in terms of personnel), so revenue info is scarce. Their revenue comes from creative consultancy fees and commissions on artist projects. They have diversified services – **art direction, graphic design services, content creation, and representation** ([20 best illustration agents in the UK, and the awesome illustrators they represent | Creative Boom](https://www.creativeboom.com/resources/20-best-illustration-agents-in-the-uk/#:~:text=Headquartered%20in%20London%2C%20Big%20Active,and%203D%20artist%20Jack%20Sachs)) – which means multiple income streams. They likely handle entire projects (which brings in project fees) and also simply represent artists for commissions (earning a rep commission). Because they engage in high-end projects (e.g., designing visuals for global fashion campaigns or major album releases), each project can be lucrative. The agency’s size implies they manage their workload carefully; profitability would depend on maintaining a steady flow of projects in their niche. They’ve sustained for decades, so presumably they are profitable. One possible weakness financially is that being closely tied to sectors like music (which has had budget fluctuations over time) could pose challenges, but Big Active has successfully pivoted more into brand and content work to compensate. Overall, while not a giant money-maker like some broad agencies, Big Active likely enjoys solid profit margins due to its specialized focus and reputation – clients pay a premium for their expertise.  
* **Fame & Publicity Strategies:** Big Active’s publicity has historically come from the **fame of its projects**. For example, when a Big Active artist creates an album cover for a famous musician or a campaign for a revered fashion label, that project itself garners press and credit to Big Active. They have been featured in design publications and interviews (the founders and artists often share insights at conferences or in articles about illustration trends). Additionally, Big Active’s **award recognitions (D\&AD, etc.)** serve as publicity, as winning awards gets them mentioned in industry news. They also participate in industry events: design lectures, university talks (as evidenced by a university blog recounting a Big Active talk where the agent gave advice to students ([Future Selves: BIG ACTIVE | Illustration L5](https://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/sophieleary/2020/02/08/future-selves-big-active/#:~:text=BIG%20ACTIVE%20is%20an%20artist,of%20moving%20image%20like%20instagram))). Their strategies seem to focus on *inspirational thought leadership* – talking about the business of being an artist, how Instagram affects illustration, etc. – which raises their profile among up-and-coming artists and clients alike. Social media wise, Big Active keeps an Instagram showcasing new and innovative work from their artists, positioning them as always on the pulse of current trends (e.g., featuring experimental video art by Erik Winkowski or vibrant collages by Mat Maitland). This kind of content marketing attracts attention from brands looking for something fresh. If there’s a weakness in their publicity, it might be that they are not as aggressively self-promotional in mainstream channels – they come across as a bit “under the radar” to those outside the design niche. However, that exclusivity can also create allure. In summary, Big Active relies on **quality and uniqueness of work** plus industry accolades to maintain fame, rather than mass marketing.  
* **Digital Presence & Marketing:** The **Big Active website** and social media reflect its creative ethos. The website showcases portfolios in a clean, artful way, and emphasizes their dual nature (sections for “Music Art Direction & Design” and for “Artists” they represent, etc.) ([Big Active \- Art direction, graphic design, creative consultancy and ...](https://bigactive.com/#:~:text=Big%20Active%20,Content%20Creation%20%C2%B7%20Brand%20Identity)). They highlight case studies and mention their specializations (graphic design, content production, etc.), which helps potential clients understand the full range. On Instagram (@bigactive), they often post visually arresting images/animations produced by their talent – effectively using social media as a mini art exhibition that doubles as marketing. Their follower count is modest but the followers are likely industry folks who matter. Additionally, Big Active leverages partnerships (for instance, they have ties with amana inc in Tokyo and a Shanghai partner, extending their reach) ([amanacliq \- Magazines from Shanghai | Production Paradise](https://www.productionparadise.com/member/shanghai/amanacliq/magazines/#:~:text=amanacliq%20,visual%20solutions%20across%20photography%2C)). Marketing effectiveness for Big Active comes from targeted reputation rather than broad campaigns. They are included in lists of top agencies (e.g., ranked \#3 in *Creative Boom*’s “20 best illustration agents in the UK” ([20 best illustration agents in the UK, and the awesome illustrators they represent | Creative Boom](https://www.creativeboom.com/resources/20-best-illustration-agents-in-the-uk/#:~:text=3))), which is a marketing boost. They likely get a lot of inbound inquiries from clients specifically seeking the edgy style they’re known for. One area they could be less prominent is search engine dominance – a generic client searching “illustration agency” might find bigger names first – but those who know what they’re looking for will find Big Active’s curated presence and be impressed. Overall, Big Active’s digital and marketing approach is aligned with its brand: relatively refined, relying on its portfolio’s visual power to do the talking.
