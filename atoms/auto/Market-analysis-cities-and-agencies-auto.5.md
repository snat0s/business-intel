**Excluded** from this market scope are purely personal or non-licensed artworks – for example, personal sketches or paintings not sold/licensed to clients, or fine art pieces created for self-expression and not reproduced commercially. In essence, the focus is on **professional illustration** used in commerce, media, and entertainment, where an illustrator is hired to create work for a client or a license is granted for use of the artwork.
