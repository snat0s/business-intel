### Step 3: Develop the Licensing Model
- **Licensing Agreements**:
  - Draft standardized contracts with legal support to ensure compliance with international copyright laws, protecting both artists and the agency in global markets.
- **Pricing Strategy**:
  - **High-End Licenses**: €50,000–€100,000+ for exclusive, global, perpetual rights.
  - **Mid-Tier Licenses**: €5,000–€25,000 for limited exclusivity (e.g., regional or time-bound).
  - **Low-End Licenses**: €1,000–€5,000 for non-exclusive, limited usage, automated via the platform.
- **Revenue Sharing**:
  - Provide artists with a 50% split of licensing fees to incentivize participation and maintain fairness, particularly for top-tier talent.
