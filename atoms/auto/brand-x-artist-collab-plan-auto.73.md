* **Consider Equity or Long-Term Partnership if Appropriate**: If the collaboration is not a one-off but rather building a new product line or sub-brand, the artist can consider negotiating a more permanent stake. This could mean **equity in a new venture or a higher revenue share** once certain sales milestones are hit. For example, because Kanye West retained his Yeezy trademark, he effectively held equity in the Yeezy brand while partnering with Adidas ([Kanye's Yeezy is a Multi-Billion Dollar Business and Still Growing](https://www.thefashionlaw.com/kanye-wests-yeezy-venture-is-worth-1-billion-and-growing/#:~:text=appears%20to%20be%20an%20unprecedented,from%20his%20partnership%20with%20Nike)). This set him up to continue benefiting even if the partnership structure changed. Visual artists might not often create billion-dollar sneaker lines, but if a brand wants an ongoing series or the artist’s name on a collection every season, it’s fair to discuss profit-sharing beyond standard royalties. An equity stake or joint venture approach is complex, but it maximizes the artist’s long-term upside and control.
