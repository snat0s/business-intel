Agent Pekka’s core **values** have remained consistent since its founding and have even grown stronger. The agency prides itself on *“championing originality, newness and craft.”* ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=We%27re%20a%20global%20artist%20representation,Los%20Angeles%2C%20and%20work%20everywhere)) This ethos is reflected in how they select artists and projects. The roster is *hand-picked* and kept relatively curated (currently around 40-50 artists in total) to ensure a high standard of work and to give each artist personalized attention ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20dedicated%20to%203D%2C%20animation%2C,diverse%20as%20they%20are%20distinctive)). The artists represented span a broad range of disciplines – from traditional illustration and graphic design to 3D art, animation, character design, installations, and typography ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20dedicated%20to%203D%2C%20animation%2C,diverse%20as%20they%20are%20distinctive)). What unites this diverse group is a distinctive style and a commitment to quality; Agent Pekka looks for artists who have a strong voice and craft, whether they are established names or emerging newcomers.
