### Step 6: Expand the Artist Roster
- **Recruitment**:
  - Attract new artists via art schools, online platforms, and industry networks, emphasizing the 50% revenue split and licensing opportunities.
  - Utilize the growing sales force to scout local talent in new markets like Paris and Shanghai.
- **Onboarding**:
  - Implement a streamlined process for contract signing, artwork submission, and platform integration.
- **Goal**:
  - Double the artist roster annually (e.g., 100 artists in Year 2, 200 in Year 3), supported by the expanding sales force.
