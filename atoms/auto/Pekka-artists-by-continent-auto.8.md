### Notes:
- Europe dominates the list, with a strong concentration in creative hubs like London, Paris, Helsinki, and Barcelona. This aligns with Agent Pekka’s European roots (Helsinki and Amsterdam offices).
- North America has a notable presence, particularly in New York and Brooklyn, reflecting the agency’s foothold in the U.S. market.
- South America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania have fewer representatives, with only a handful of artists identified in specific cities like Santiago, Seoul, and Buenos Aires.
- If an artist’s location wasn’t clear or they’ve relocated recently, I stuck with the most documented city from their profiles or Agent Pekka’s listings. For a more exhaustive or updated breakdown, I could dig deeper into web or X posts if you’d like!
