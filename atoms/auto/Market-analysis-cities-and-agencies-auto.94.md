In summary, **Agent Pekka holds its own by carving a niche**: It is **smaller and more specialized** than the big agencies, but operates globally and is respected for high-quality, innovative illustration work. Its revenue is lower than the mega-agencies, but it compensates with a strong brand identity and loyal relationships. Agent Pekka’s **competitive advantages** include its curated roster of distinctive artists, personalized service, and roots in the design-centric Nordic region (which can be a unique selling point). Compared to leading agencies, Agent Pekka is like a boutique firm versus a multinational firm – it may not compete on volume, but it competes on **creativity and originality**. As the illustration market grows, Agent Pekka’s approach positions it well to attract clients specifically looking for fresh visual solutions, complementing (rather than directly overtaking) what larger agencies offer.
