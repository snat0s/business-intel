* **What It Is:** The artist earns a percentage of the sales revenue from products that carry their name/design. This can be based on gross or net sales.  
* **Sums Involved:**  
  * **Typical Royalty Percentages:** Often in the 3–10% range, although the exact percentage depends on the industry standard for the product type and the artist’s clout.  
  * **Overall Earnings:** If a product line generates hundreds of millions in sales (as seen with blockbuster collaborations), even a small percentage can translate into significant, ongoing income.
