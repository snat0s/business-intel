Another challenge came from **operating on the international stage as a newcomer**. Entering established markets like Western Europe and North America meant facing well-entrenched competitors (long-running illustration agencies in London, New York, etc.). Agent Pekka’s strategy to overcome this was to leverage the uniqueness of its talent roster and the reputation it had built. By maintaining a high bar for originality and craft, the agency ensured that it offered something distinctive. It positioned itself as a *boutique* agency with “original and contemporary” artists, appealing to clients seeking fresh voices ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=Established%20in%202007%2C%20Agent%20Pekka,Sony%2C%20Warner%20Music%2C%20and%20Nike)). Additionally, the agency’s Finnish roots – a sort of Nordic design mystique – became a subtle selling point, as Scandinavian design and art held an allure for many global brands. Agent Pekka turned what could have been a challenge (being from a small country) into a strength by proudly carrying the “blue-cross flag” of Finland into the global arena ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=Pekka%E2%80%99s%20goal%20is%20to%20make,Christmas%20campaign%2C%20created%20by%20the)).
