* **Legal and Administrative Framework**:  
  * Establish a local company fully owned by Agent Pekka Oy, with the founding agent holding a 15% ownership stake.  
  * Ensure compliance with local legal requirements for entity formation, including drafting necessary corporate documentation.  
  * Secure a registered address through leasing or shared office services.  
  * Hire a bookkeeper to ensure financial records comply with local standards.  
* **Flexible Operational Models**:  
  * **Freelance through Founding Agent’s Company**:  
    * Allow the agent to freelance for Agent Pekka Oy via their own company for 12 months. This provides a cost-effective way to test the market.  
    * Transition to a formal structure if the market responds positively.  
  * **Establish a Local Subsidiary**:  
    * Set up a local entity within 2-3 months.  
    * Have the founding agent freelance through their company for the first 12 months before transitioning to direct operations.  
  * **Direct Employment**:  
    * Hire the founding agent as a salaried employee under the newly formed entity, though this is the least flexible and most costly option.  
* **Physical Setup**:  
  * Operate from shared offices or co-working spaces to minimize costs while ensuring access to essential facilities.  
  * Equip the founding agent with necessary tools, including a laptop, phone, and reliable internet connection.
