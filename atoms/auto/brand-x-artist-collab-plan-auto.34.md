– Outlander\]([https://outlandermag.com/blogs/talk-of-the-land/free-game-from-a-lawyer-for-creatives\#:\~:text=,for%20more%20control%2C%20especially%20when](https://outlandermag.com/blogs/talk-of-the-land/free-game-from-a-lawyer-for-creatives#:~:text=,for%20more%20control%2C%20especially%20when))). The brand pays a fee or royalty for this usage. This is common when brands use **existing artworks or motifs**. For example, the Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat or the Andy Warhol Foundation frequently license artwork to fashion retailers (Uniqlo, Coach, etc.) for apparel lines, in return for royalties or licensing fees ([Basquiat, Inc.: How the Artist’s Estate Built a Licensing Empire of Branded Barbies, Dog Hoodies, Coach Backpacks, and More](https://news.artnet.com/market/jean-michel-basquiat-inc-licensing-empire-2100008#:~:text=estates%2C%20and%20big%20brands,7%20million%20in%202019)). Licensing deals ensure the artist’s IP is protected (the art returns to the artist/estate after the license term) while providing the brand a marketing edge through association with famous art.
