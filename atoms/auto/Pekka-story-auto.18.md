Crucially, this early success also made Agent Pekka attractive to non-Finnish illustrators. Artists from abroad recognized that Agent Pekka was championing exciting work and connecting it with big clients. The roster, which initially featured only Finns, soon expanded to include international names. By 2011–2012, illustrators such as Holly Wales and Owen Gatley from the UK, and Mike Perry from the US, had joined Agent Pekka’s lineup ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=The%20exhibition%20at%20GUNS%20%26,Antti%20Uotila%20and%20Holly%20Wales)). This cosmopolitan mix of talent demonstrated how quickly the agency had grown beyond its Finnish roots. In fact, industry observers noted that Agent Pekka’s “eye for talent \[was\] consistently faultless across a whole gamut of styles,” highlighting how it curated artists globally without sacrificing quality ([Finnish illustration brilliance goes Dutch as Agent Pekka sets up Amsterdam office](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/agent-pekka-amsterdam-show#:~:text=They%20have%20marked%20the%20move,a%20whole%20gamut%20of%20styles)).
