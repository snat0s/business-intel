* **Artist Network:** ATRBUTE (spelled without an “I”) is a **global talent agency** that has a broad and modern roster. They represent **illustrators, digital artists, CGI specialists, muralists, photographers, animation studios, and directors** under one umbrella ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/contact#:~:text=,their%20work%20with%20iconic%20brands)). In other words, ATRBUTE combines traditional artist representation with areas like creative tech (CGI, animation) and even has separate divisions (ATRBUTE Studios and ATRBUTE Labs) for production and experimental projects ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/contact#:~:text=,their%20work%20with%20iconic%20brands)). The network includes a mix of emerging and established talent; many artists have a focus on cutting-edge digital art and new media. A notable figure at ATRBUTE is **Howard Bernstein as CEO** (formerly founder of B\&A), indicating that top industry talent is also leading the agency’s strategy ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/contact#:~:text=HOWARD%20BERNSTEIN)). The **quality** of ATRBUTE’s artist network is high and multi-faceted – for example, one can find illustrators who do contemporary graphics, as well as photographers and even AR/VR artists. This diversity is a key strength, allowing ATRBUTE to offer clients a “one-stop” solution for almost any visual need. The only caution is that maintaining such a broad roster means they must avoid being seen as too generalized; however, ATRBUTE addresses this by having specialized agents/partners heading each category (photography, art/illustration, etc.) ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/contact#:~:text=HOWARD%20BERNSTEIN)) ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/contact#:~:text=AARON%20LLOYD%20BARR)), so expertise isn’t lost.  
* **Client Portfolio & Collaborations:** ATRBUTE’s clientele includes many **iconic global brands**, reflecting the agency’s strategic focus on partnering artists with top-tier companies ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/contact#:~:text=We%27re%20strategists%20and%20artist%20managers,their%20work%20with%20iconic%20brands)). Through their artists, ATRBUTE has been involved in projects for brands like **Apple, Samsung, Adidas, Nike, Dior, Coach, Vogue, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Netflix** and more. For instance, one of their illustrators, Wolfgang Zac, has done work for **Apple, Samsung, Adidas, Jack Daniel’s, Jägermeister, Red Bull** and other major brands ([Wolfgang Zac \- Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/artists/Wolfgang-Zac?cat=about#:~:text=Wolfgang%20Zac%20,White%20Claw%2C%20US%20Army%2C)). Another example: their Instagram showcases a collaboration *Weareseventeen x Tissot x NBA* (mixing an animation studio with a watch brand and the NBA) ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/#:~:text=Weareseventeen%20x%20Tissot%20x%20NBA)), and *Victor Llorente x The New Yorker x FKA Twigs* (photography for a magazine feature with a celebrity) ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/#:~:text=Weareseventeen%20x%20Tissot%20x%20NBA)). These examples show ATRBUTE’s range – from advertising campaigns and product collaborations to editorial and entertainment content. A strong part of their strategy is connecting **artists to brand campaigns** that are culturally relevant (NBA, fashion, etc.) which raises the profile of both the artist and ATRBUTE. The client list skews toward industries like fashion/beauty (e.g. Kiehl’s, mentioned in a Lunar New Year campaign with ATRBUTE Labs) ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/#:~:text=)), tech and consumer products, and media. This broad yet high-caliber client portfolio is a major strength. There’s hardly a notable weakness in their client lineup, except that as a newer agency (founded in the 2010s), they may still be expanding their reach in certain sectors. But landing clients like **Nike, McDonald’s, and Vogue** (as indicated by their social posts and artist bios ([ATRBUTE (@atrbute) • Instagram photos and videos](https://www.instagram.com/atrbute/?hl=en#:~:text=This%20makes%20his%20artistry%20profoundly,People%2C%20Free%20Assembly%2C%20Nike%2C))) shows they are already competing at the top level.  
* **Brand Image & Public Perception:** ATRBUTE projects a **dynamic and innovative brand image**. It markets itself as a forward-thinking, “new generation” talent agency that *“champions original voices in an ever-evolving age of media”* ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/contact#:~:text=,their%20work%20with%20iconic%20brands)). Because it was founded by industry veterans (with pedigrees from older agencies) but designed for the modern media landscape, it has a reputation for combining experience with fresh perspective. Public perception of ATRBUTE is that it’s very **trend-aware and versatile** – their inclusion of things like a Labs division implies they’re exploring emerging platforms (possibly NFTs, immersive art, etc.). They’re seen as a **global player**: they have partners/agents in New York, Los Angeles, London, and likely connections in other markets (the team includes a London director, indicating transatlantic operations ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/contact#:~:text=Jack%20Cox))). ATRBUTE’s brand is also tied to being **full-service**; clients might think of them not just for a freelance illustrator, but for production needs, large-scale campaign coordination, and even brand strategy via visuals. This holistic, modern brand image is a strong differentiator. Since they are relatively new, their public profile is still growing – they may not have the same name recognition yet as some older agencies among all clients, but within the circle of brands and artists plugged into contemporary digital art trends, ATRBUTE is gaining a solid reputation.  
* **Revenue & Profitability:** ATRBUTE’s revenue likely benefits from its multi-pronged business model. By representing artists in traditional commission arrangements and also executing productions (through ATRBUTE Studios) and experimental projects (Labs), they can capture more value per project. For example, a client might hire an ATRBUTE illustrator for a campaign and also use ATRBUTE Studios to produce animated ads with that artwork – ATRBUTE would earn both a commission and production fees. With leadership like Howard Bernstein, one can assume they have solid business development. Though figures aren’t public, ATRBUTE has grown fast, suggesting healthy finances. They have multiple partners and agents on staff ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/contact#:~:text=HOWARD%20BERNSTEIN)) ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/contact#:~:text=JEFF%20CHURCH)), indicating investment in talent on the agency side too. If there’s a weakness or risk, it’s the challenge of managing a broad scope – ensuring profitability in each division (rep vs. production) requires careful management. Also, being newer, they may have had to invest heavily in building the brand and team. However, given their big-brand projects and perhaps some legacy client relationships ported over by their principals, ATRBUTE is likely generating strong revenues. Their **global outlook** means they can tap into revenue streams in different markets (e.g., European luxury brands, US tech firms, Asian gaming companies). Overall, ATRBUTE appears to be on a solid financial trajectory, balancing growth with high-value projects.  
* **Fame & Publicity Strategies:** ATRBUTE has been actively raising its profile through **social media and high-visibility projects**. The agency’s Instagram and web news feed highlight notable projects (like collaborations with celebrities or global events), which organically generate buzz. For instance, showcasing a project with **David Beckham** or an **NBA partnership** on their site draws attention ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/#:~:text=)). They also announce when their artists work with cultural icons (e.g., FKA Twigs for The New Yorker piece) – these tie-ins act as publicity, as fans of those brands or artists take note. Additionally, ATRBUTE leverages the **networks of its leadership**: Howard Bernstein’s long-standing connections likely help ATRBUTE get mentioned in industry news (the launch of ATRBUTE a few years back was itself news in the creative industry). The agency might not be as known to the general public, but among brand marketing circles they’ve been making a splash by touting their comprehensive approach. Another strategy is **thought leadership via ATRBUTE Labs**: by exploring new media (perhaps publishing case studies or insights on AR/VR art, Metaverse content, etc.), they position themselves as ahead of the curve, which attracts press interested in how agencies evolve. In terms of events, ATRBUTE people possibly participate in panels or judging creative awards, further building name recognition. One notable aspect: ATRBUTE’s branding is modern and bold – even the all-caps stylized name stands out – which helps in marketing materials. A minor weakness is just the challenge of breaking through the noise as a newer entrant; they have to continually attach themselves to big names (which they are doing successfully) to cement their place. So far, their publicity approach seems effective, as ATRBUTE is increasingly cited as a **model of the “new wave” of artist agencies** that do it all.  
* **Digital Presence & Marketing:** ATRBUTE’s digital presence is comprehensive and sleek. Their **website** is organized to show the breadth of what they do: you can navigate by category (Photography, Art & Illustration, CGI, Animation, etc.) ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/#:~:text=)), which is user-friendly for clients looking for specific types of talent. They also have dedicated sites for Studios and Labs, which are linked – giving a sense that this is an integrated platform. Notably, ATRBUTE’s site and social content frequently mention collaborations in a concise “X artist x Y client” format, almost like case-study headlines (e.g., *“ATRBUTE Labs x Kiehl's – Lunar New Year Collection”*) ([Atrbute](https://www.atrbute.com/#:~:text=)). This highlights their work in a quick, digestible way. Their **marketing** heavily leans on showcasing project successes and the star power of clients/artists. They keep news updated on the site, which aids SEO and signals an active agency. On social media, ATRBUTE is quite active – Instagram, in particular, is used to spotlight new campaigns, artist achievements, and press mentions. They also engage in cross-promotion: for example, when an artist does a public exhibition or an interview, ATRBUTE shares that, tying the agency name to culturally relevant content. This digital strategy is effective in attracting both new artists (who see ATRBUTE as a vibrant agency working with cool brands) and clients (who see evidence of quality work). They appear to invest in **visual storytelling in their marketing**, understandable given their field: high-quality videos, animations, and images populate their feeds. In sum, ATRBUTE’s online and marketing presence is strong, contemporary, and aligned with how modern clients discover agencies – through compelling content and social proof.
