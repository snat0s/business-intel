* **Uniqlo UT Collections (Warhol, Haring, KAWS, etc.)** – *Mass-Market Success*: Fast Retailing’s Uniqlo has a dedicated line called UT which issues affordable t-shirts and apparel featuring renowned artists’ work. Notable partnerships include the Andy Warhol Foundation, Keith Haring Foundation, Jean-Michel Basquiat’s estate, and contemporary artist KAWS. These deals are **licensing-driven** – e.g. the Warhol Foundation licenses Warhol imagery to Uniqlo, typically for a royalty on each shirt sold. The scale can be massive: Uniqlo sells these tees worldwide at \~$15 each, often in the millions of units. The **Andy Warhol Foundation earned $10.7 million in licensing revenue in 2019**, much of it from fashion collaborations like those with Uniqlo ([Basquiat, Inc.: How the Artist’s Estate Built a Licensing Empire of Branded Barbies, Dog Hoodies, Coach Backpacks, and More](https://news.artnet.com/market/jean-michel-basquiat-inc-licensing-empire-2100008#:~:text=estates%2C%20and%20big%20brands,7%20million%20in%202019)). KAWS, a living artist, had multiple Uniqlo drops that caused shopping frenzies – one 2019 launch saw *“bedlam” in China as fans and resellers **“battle it out”*** in stores for KAWS x Uniqlo shirts ([Watch Shoppers Maim and Trample Each Other to Get KAWS’s New UNIQLO T-Shirts in These Horrifying Videos](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/watch-shoppers-trample-each-other-kaws-uniqlo-1563415#:~:text=match%20at%20L168%20missile%20full,of%20the%C2%A0KAWS%20x%20UNIQLO%20UT%C2%A0line)). While exact sales figures aren’t public, the hype suggests these collections have been enormously profitable. The structure generally involves a **flat licensing fee or royalty per item** to the artist, but because of Uniqlo’s volume, even a small per-shirt royalty can yield a significant sum. This model shows that artist collabs aren’t limited to luxury – they can drive huge revenues in the mass market too, if priced accessibly and distributed widely.
