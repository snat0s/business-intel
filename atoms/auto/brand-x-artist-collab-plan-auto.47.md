* **Louis Vuitton x Yayoi Kusama (2012 & 2023\)** – *Art Reinvigorating Luxury*: Following the success with Murakami, Louis Vuitton tapped Japanese avant-garde artist Yayoi Kusama for collaborations in 2012 and again a decade later. Kusama’s signature polka dots and motifs were applied to handbags and apparel. The first collaboration was very well received (products often sold out, and some pieces became collector’s items). In 2023, LV revived the partnership with an even larger collection. While financials weren’t disclosed, analysts noted it as a strategy to boost sales in Asia ([From Yayoi Kusama to Takashi Murakami, Louis Vuitton bids on revivals to improve Asia performance | Jing Daily](https://jingdaily.com/posts/shanghai-queues-for-louis-vuitton-x-takashi-murakami#:~:text=Can%20Louis%20Vuitton%20x%20Murakami,repeat%20its%20%24300M%20success)) and drive traffic with experiential pop-ups. It’s likely Kusama’s deal, similar to Murakami’s, involved a **license for her polka-dot motifs** and a combination of **upfront payment \+ royalties** for the limited-time use. These case studies underscore how a well-chosen artist can refresh a brand’s image and translate into strong commercial results (the 2012 Kusama collection reportedly had waitlists for many items).
