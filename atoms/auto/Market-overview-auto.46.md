**e. Develop Value-Added Services (Licensing & IP deals):** Given Agent Pekka’s specialization in **digital art licensing** and visual storytelling, it can capitalize on the booming licensing trend. One idea is to create an **in-house licensing program or library** – a curated collection of artworks from its artists available for licensing to product manufacturers, editorial use, etc. Agent Pekka could, for example, broker deals for its artists to license designs to apparel, home decor, or tech accessory companies (art licensing is a $7B+ segment and growing ([License It \- The Graphic Artist Guild](https://graphicartistsguild.org/license-it/#:~:text=License%20It%20,a%20variety%20of%20products))). Proactively connecting artists to licensing opportunities (like illustration prints for retail products, or art prints sales via an online store or print-on-demand partnerships) can open a new revenue stream and differentiate Agent Pekka as not just a commission-based agency but a **licensing agency** too. They can take inspiration from how some agencies (e.g., Illustration agencies and galleries) run online shops or partner with retailers. Additionally, exploring **IP development** could be fruitful: if any represented artists have characters or stories, Agent Pekka could help pitch those for media (think along the lines of illustrators who create children’s book IP or animated series concepts). It might be beyond the traditional scope, but even facilitating a simple product line (like limited edition art prints or merchandise with Agent Pekka artists) and publicizing it can build the brand and income.
