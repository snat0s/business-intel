**7\. Beijing (China):** *Government, Media and Tech Illustration Needs.* Beijing, China’s capital, is another center of illustr ([Creative Agency \- Neocha](https://neocha.com/creative-agency/#:~:text=Creative%20Agency%20,winning)) though slightly different in character from Shanghai. Beijing is home to many of China’s largest **state media outlets**, \*\*publishi ([Contact \- IllustrationX](https://www.illustrationx.com/contact/br#:~:text=Contact%20,advertising%20agencies%20and%20creative%20studios)) and a growing tech scene (e.g., Baidu, Bytedance). **Industries:** Publishing and media are key – educational publishing (textbooks, children’s books in Mandarin) is largely run out of Beijing, requiring illustrators; state media and news (like Xinhua, People’s Daily) often use infographics and editorial illustrations for communication; and advertising (especially for state-owned enterprises or government campaigns) uses illustration for public service announcements, etc. Beijing’s **gaming and tech** companies also commission art (though some game art studios are in Shenzhen/Guangzhou). In terms of agencies, Beijing has a less international scene than Shanghai, but local studios function in a similar capacity – for example, **CreativeCN** and **IlluStation** are Beijing-based collectives connecting illustrators to clients. *Notable agencies:* While not many Western agencies have an office in Beijing, some have local partners. Also, some Beijing-based design firms (like **MAD Illustrations**) represent multiple artists. Given Beijing’s vast publishing output (China is one of the largest publishing markets globally), the city generates a high volume of commissioned illustrations (think of all the children’s book illustrations and educational diagrams produced). The difference is that much of this is handled internally by publishers rather than through independent agents. Nonetheless, in terms of total illustration work happening (and associated revenue), Beijing ranks among the top cities globally.
