The global financial size of the illustration market is significant, given the ubiquity of visual content in media and marketing. Estimates vary due to the market’s fragmented nature, but it clearly reaches into the tens of billions (USD) annually when combining all licensed and commissioned work. For instance, one major component – the stock illustration segment (pre-created images licensed for use) – was valued at around $200 billion in 2023\. This reflects the huge demand for ready-made illustrations in advertising, publishing, web design, education, and other fields.
