**Asia-Pacific** – The Asia-Pacific region’s illustration market has been growing rapidly. Japan and China lead in demand: Japan has a long tradition of illustration in media (manga, anime, print publishing) and a huge “character business” industry, while China’s expanding advertising and gaming sectors increasingly utilize professional illustrators. Notably, new digital avenues in Asia are boosting the market – in Japan, the rise of online commission platforms and fan patronage has created a “creator illustration” economy, estimated at ¥24.7 billion in FY2023 (\~$165 million) just in platform-based transactions. This is in addition to traditional corporate commissions. Asia-Pacific also sees illustrators serving the booming mobile gaming and animation industries. Overall, APAC’s share of the global illustration market is on the rise, and the region is expected to see high growth rates in coming years as visual content needs expand with digital media usage.
