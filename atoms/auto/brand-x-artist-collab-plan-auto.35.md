* **Equity Stakes and Joint Ventures**: In rare cases, an artist might obtain an **equity stake** in a collaboration or form a joint venture with the brand. This typically occurs in very high-profile, long-term partnerships where the artist’s brand is central to the product’s identity. A notable example is Kanye West’s Yeezy deal with Adidas: West **retained ownership of the Yeezy brand** name and trademarks and essentially licensed it to Adidas, rather than transferring it ([Kanye's Yeezy is a Multi-Billion Dollar Business and Still Growing](https://www.thefashionlaw.com/kanye-wests-yeezy-venture-is-worth-1-billion-and-growing/#:~:text=appears%20to%20be%20an%20unprecedented,from%20his%20partnership%20with%20Nike)). This gave him more control and a residual stake in the brand’s value. Similarly, some celebrity artists have negotiated joint ownership of new product lines (e.g. Rihanna’s Fenty fashion house was a joint venture with LVMH). For visual artists, outright equity deals are less common than royalties or fees, but the principle is that an artist could negotiate **shares or profit equity** if their name and IP are creating a substantial portion of the business’s value. This can yield huge upside if the product line grows into a standalone brand.
