By the late 2010s, Agent Pekka was often cited as representing *“one of the best rosters of illustrators in the world.”* ([Agent Pekka — Violaine & Jérémy](https://www.violaineetjeremy.fr/project/agent-pekka#:~:text=Complete%20rebranding%20of%20Agent%20Pekka%27s,%E2%9C%BA)) This reputation was cemented by the agency’s consistency in nurturing talent and delivering quality. A mid-2010s rebranding of Agent Pekka’s identity (by the design atelier Violaine & Jérémy) underscored its evolution into a mature brand: the new visual identity evoked the signage of an old workshop, symbolically blending a sense of long-standing craft with modern sharpness ([Agent Pekka — Violaine & Jérémy](https://www.violaineetjeremy.fr/project/agent-pekka#:~:text=Finland%20and%20opened%20offices%20in,%E2%9C%BA)). It was a statement that Agent Pekka, though only founded in 2007, had become an institution in its own right in the illustration community.
