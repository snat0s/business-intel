**18\. Montréal (Canada):** *Gaming and Publishing (Francophone and Anglophone).* Montreal is Canada’s second city for illustration after Toronto, with some unique drivers. It’s a major **video game development center** (hosting studios for Ubisoft, EA, etc.), which generates a lot of concept art and game illustration work. It’s also the center of Francophone Canadian publishing (children’s books, comics, etc. in French) and has a vibrant comic art scene (influenced by European comics). **Industries:** Gaming (concept illustrators and character designers in high demand; many of these artists are represented by agents when freelancing), **advertising** (Montreal’s ad scene caters to Quebec and often has a distinct style; illustrators are used in ads and marketing materials, sometimes with a more artistic/indie flair reflective of Montreal’s culture), and **publishing/media** (illustration for French-language magazines, educational materials for Canadian schools, etc.). *Notable agencies:* **Anna Goodson Illustration Agency** is headquartered in Montreal and is internationally recognized – it represents artists globally and serves clients in North America and Europe. This agency’s presence alone makes Montreal significant in the agency world. Also, **Illustration Québec** is an association that promotes illustrators and connects them with clients (not an agency per se, but a structured marketplace for Montreal illustrators). Additionally, some U.S. agencies recruit Montreal talent due to the city’s pool of skilled artists (many coming out of schools like Concordia or UQAM). Considering the volume of work (especially from the game industry in Montreal, which often goes untracked publicly because work is in-house or contracted), Montreal likely generates a large sum of illustration work value, justifying a spot in the ([Anna Goodson / Talks about why Diversity plays such an important ...](https://www.agoodson.com/podcast-branding-matters/#:~:text=,world%27s%20leading%20Illustration%20agencies)) . São Paulo (Brazil):\*\* *Latin America’s Largest Advertising Market.* São Paulo is the economic engine of Brazil and home to its biggest advertising agencies and media companies. Many global brands’ Latin American campaigns are created in São Paulo (or adapted by São Paulo agencies), leading to demand for commercial illustration and animation. **Industries:** Advertising is the big one – Brazil’s advertising spend is the highest in Latin America, and São Paulo agencies create work for consumer goods, telecom, banking, and especially **creative TV commercials and print ads** that often utilize illustration (Brazil has an award-winning ad industry known for creative visuals). Additionally, **editorial** (São Paulo has many magazines, newspapers, and an emerging startup scene creating content that uses illustration). Brazil also has a **comic and animation** scene (e.g., MSP’s Monica’s Gang comics), but those are more internal. *Notable agencies:* There are illustration agencies like **Norte** in São Paulo which specialize in artists’ representation and copyright management for the Brazilian market. **GERA Illustration Agency** (also in Brazil) showcases work for clients like Greenpeace, Red Bull, Panini, etc., indicating a diverse client base. International agencies haven’t deeply entered Brazil due to language and market differences, so local agencies fill the gap. Also, artists like those in the **Collectivemind** or **LAB607** often collaborate on commercial work. The city’s inclusion in the top 20 is warranted by the sheer size of Brazil’s ad market and the presence of multiple specialist agencies – collectively, São Paulo’s illustration commissions (from magazine spots to big ad campaigns and design projects) represent the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.
