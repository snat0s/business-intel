**(Honorable Mentions):** Other cities are also notable but just outside the top 20 by revenue: **Moscow** (Russia’s advertising and publishing center, though somewhat insular), **Mumbai** (India’s advertising industry is large, but illustrators are often employed in-house or through design firms rather than agencies, keeping it just out of the top tier), **Madrid** (Spain’s capital has a robust illustration scene for advertising and one of the world’s largest comic/children’s book fairs in nearby Bologna, but many Spanish illustrators are actually represented through UK or French agencies), and **Los Angeles** which is already listed (\#4). Additionally, **Dubai** is an emerging advertising hub in the Middle East using global talent, and **Warsaw** or **Warsaw** (Poland) has a growing game and design industry. However, the 20 cities above are the most *consistently active and revenue-generating* for illustration agencies.
