By around 2010, the impact of Agent Pekka’s efforts was clearly visible. The agency was proactive in showcasing its illustrators internationally – for example, by attending industry events like Le Book Connections in cities such as Paris, London, New York, and Hamburg ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=Pekka%E2%80%99s%20goal%20is%20to%20make,Christmas%20campaign%2C%20created%20by%20the)). Such moves paid off. As early as 2010, fully one-third of Agent Pekka’s clients were outside of Finland, with projects coming from the United States, UK, across Europe, and even Asia ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=under%20the%20blue,entire%20campaign%20was%20based%20on)). This was a remarkable achievement for a young agency and evidence that Finnish illustrators, under Agent Pekka’s representation, were gaining global recognition. A flagship project during these years was a high-profile campaign for Nokia in the UK, where London’s Wieden+Kennedy agency built an entire Christmas advertising campaign around illustrations by Janine Rewell – one of Agent Pekka’s Finnish artists ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=most%20of%20them%20in%20the,to%20see%20how%20the%20illustration)). The campaign spanned store displays, outdoor ads, web content, print, and packaging, all unified by Rewell’s creative work, demonstrating the agency’s ability to integrate illustration into major international marketing efforts ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=most%20of%20them%20in%20the,to%20see%20how%20the%20illustration)).
