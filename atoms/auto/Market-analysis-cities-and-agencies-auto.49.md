**North America** – North America (especially the United States) commands a large share of the illustration market thanks to its robust advertising, publishing, and entertainment industries. The United States alone accounts for several billion in illustration spending; one estimate put the U.S. illustration industry at roughly $3.5 billion in recent years (primarily commissioned work). Major publishing houses, media outlets, and ad agencies in the U.S. and Canada drive demand for editorial art, book illustrations, and marketing visuals.
