* **Licensing Platform:** A SaaS platform that automates "bulk" licensing. This is the scalable version of the bespoke licensing business model. It automates art ingest from much broader artist base.

The aim is to have a licensing platform that caters large user base in artists and buyers but does not compete with the high end.
