**10\. Chicago (USA):** *Advertising and Publishing Hub of the U.S. Midwest.* Chicago boasts a historically strong advertising industry – big consumer goods companies (McDonald’s, Kraft, etc.) and marketing firms are headquartered in Chicago. These companies frequently need illustration for packaging, advertising, and social media. Chicago is also known for its **publishing of children’s books and educational materials** (several educational publishing companies are or were based in the area, and magazines like *Playboy* were founded there). **Industries:** Advertising is number one (especially for food, beverage, and corporate advertising – Chicago agencies handle many national campaigns), followed by publishing/education (e.g., **Scott Foresman** and other textbook publishers historically commissioned lots of illustration in Chicago). The design and architecture sector in Chicago also uses technical illustrators (for infographics, architectural renderings). *Notable agencies:* **MCB Illustration** and **Scott Hull Associates** (though Scott Hull is based in Ohio, he represents many artists in the Midwest). There’s also **Visual Connections** in Chicago, and agencies like **Mendola** or **Rapp Art** from NY often visit Chicago clients. The city has a large pool of freelance illustrators and cartoonists, supported by entities like the **Chicago Society of Illustrators**. While some work is routed through New York agents, Chicago generates a significant amount of illustration business in its own right – enough to place it comfortably in the global top 20 cities.
