– Outlander\]([https://outlandermag.com/blogs/talk-of-the-land/free-game-from-a-lawyer-for-creatives\#:\~:text=Trademarks%3A%20A%20Question%20of%20Identity](https://outlandermag.com/blogs/talk-of-the-land/free-game-from-a-lawyer-for-creatives#:~:text=Trademarks%3A%20A%20Question%20of%20Identity))), but the art provides the collection’s edge. Financial details are kept private, but given Supreme’s business model, artists likely receive an upfront licensing fee or a small percentage of sales. The runs are typically small (which creates scarcity and huge resale value), so from the artist’s perspective these deals are more about cultural impact and a quick payout than long-term royalties. Still, they can be lucrative: Supreme’s limited products often sell out in seconds at retail, then resell for many times the price, indicating the **high profit margins** these collaborations generate (profits which the brand and artist share per their agreement).
