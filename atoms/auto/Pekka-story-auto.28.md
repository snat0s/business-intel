The list of **successes** for Agent Pekka is long. Its artists have worked on campaigns for nearly every industry-leading brand, from tech giants to fashion labels. Over the years, Agent Pekka’s portfolio of clients grew to include names like **Apple, Nike, Google, Adobe, Facebook, and Toyota**, among dozens of other global brands ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=Brands%20include%3A%C2%A0Absolut%20Vodka%2C%20Adidas%2C%20Adobe%2C,Toyota%2C%20Vogue%20Eyewear%20and%20Volkswagen)). The agency also collaborated with top advertising agencies worldwide – from Wieden+Kennedy and Droga5 to Ogilvy and DDB – meaning its illustrators contributed to high-profile campaigns seen by millions ([Agent Pekka](https://www.gosee.news/agentpekka/page/about#:~:text=Agencies%20include%3A%202x4%2C%2072andSunny%2C%20180Amsterdam%2C,Wieden%2BKennedy%2C%20Winkreative%20and%20Wolff%20Olins)). Importantly, many of Agent Pekka’s illustrators have achieved individual acclaim, winning awards and recognition partly thanks to the opportunities and guidance the agency provided. For example, Janine Rewell, one of the early roster members, earned a **Cannes Lions** award and was named among Print Magazine’s “20 under 30” new visual artists during her time with Agent Pekka ([Janine Rewell — About](https://janinerewell.com/about/#:~:text=2011%20Best%20Of%20The%20Year,FI)) ([Janine Rewell — About](https://janinerewell.com/about/#:~:text=2009%20Design%20Lion%2C%20Bronze%20Cannes,FR)). Such achievements highlight how the agency not only gained commercial success but also helped push creative boundaries.
