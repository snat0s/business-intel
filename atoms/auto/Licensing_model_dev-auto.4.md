### Step 1: Define Scope and Objectives
- **Objective**: Establish a scalable licensing business using the back catalogues of current and future artists, complemented by new series to broaden the portfolio.
- **Scope**: Begin with the existing 50 artists and expand significantly as tools, operations, and the global sales force grow. Utilize new offices in Paris, Shanghai, and future locations (targeting 20 by 2027) to reach more artists and clients, driving both licensing and commissioned work.
