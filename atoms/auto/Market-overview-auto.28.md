* **Artist Network:** Making Pictures is a transatlantic artist management and production agency with offices in **London, Los Angeles, and Vancouver** ([Agency Info \- Making Pictures](https://making-pictures.com/agency-info/#:~:text=Agency%20Info%20,production%20and%20creative%20craft)). It represents a broad range of talent in **Photography, Film (directors), Illustration, Animation, and CGI** ([Making Pictures: Home](https://making-pictures.com/#:~:text=Our%20roster%20features%20exceptional%20artists,Your)) ([Agency Info \- Making Pictures](https://making-pictures.com/agency-info/#:~:text=With%20offices%20in%20Europe%20,Film%2C%20Illustration%2C%20Animation%20and%20CGI)). Within the illustration roster, Making Pictures features numerous contemporary illustrators and animators (their listed illustrators include names like Adam Avery, Aleksandar Savić, Maggie Stephenson, and many others across various styles) ([Illustration \- Making Pictures](https://making-pictures.com/illustration/artists/#:~:text=Illustration%20Artists%20%C2%B7%20Adam%20Avery,Goodman%20%C2%B7%20Arunas%20Kacinskas)). The network is fairly extensive and aims for “exceptional artists” in each category ([Agency Info \- Making Pictures](https://making-pictures.com/agency-info/#:~:text=Making%20Pictures)). A strength of Making Pictures’ artist network is the **balance of artistic quality and commercial appeal** – they tend to sign artists who are creative yet also experienced in commercial work (for advertising, editorial, etc.). Because they also manage photographers and filmmakers, there’s a cross-pollination effect: illustrators at Making Pictures might get opportunities to work alongside photographers or on multimedia projects. The agency’s talent pool is curated but not as hyper-niche as some boutique agencies; it covers a wide spectrum of aesthetics and mediums, which is attractive to clients who can source varied content from one agency. One could say their network’s breadth is similar to ATRBUTE’s in scope (minus perhaps the labs aspect) and they emphasize *“cutting-edge production”* which suggests they favor artists who are up-to-date with trends and technology. No obvious weakness stands out, except that juggling many disciplines means they must ensure illustrators get enough spotlight among photography and film talents – they’ve addressed this by having dedicated agents for each (e.g., a Director of Arts, a Head of Photography, etc.) ([Agency Info \- Making Pictures](https://making-pictures.com/agency-info/#:~:text=,13%3A%20Tim%20Higgs)) ([Agency Info \- Making Pictures](https://making-pictures.com/agency-info/#:~:text=,Lu%20Bowan)).  
* **Client Portfolio & Collaborations:** Making Pictures works on a wide range of projects, from advertising campaigns and brand content to editorial illustration and animations. While they don’t publicly list all clients, their artists’ bios and news give clues. The illustrators on their roster have worked with clients like **The New York Times, Guardian, Google, Facebook, Sephora, major publishers and agencies** (gleaned from individual profiles e.g., Paul Ryding’s profile mentions 15 years working with international clients ([Paul Ryding \- Making Pictures](https://making-pictures.com/artists/payul-ryding/#:~:text=Paul%20Ryding%20,for%20the%20past%2015%20years)), or others mention magazine and brand work). The agency highlights being a “global go-to partner for cutting-edge production” ([Agency Info \- Making Pictures](https://making-pictures.com/agency-info/#:~:text=Making%20Pictures)), which implies they have done campaigns requiring a mix of media – for example, a brand might come to them for a photo shoot that also involves illustrated elements or animation. Given their transatlantic presence, they likely count both **European and North American brands** among their clients. For instance, a UK client might be the BBC or British Airways, while a US client might be Google or Nike. They also do a lot in advertising: the company’s DNA is about production and creative services, so collaborating with advertising agencies on big brand briefs is their norm. Additionally, because they have an animation/CGI wing, they’ve likely contributed to commercials or digital ads that require those skills. Strength-wise, the variety of clients is an asset – they can serve tech, fashion, automotive, etc., due to having different types of artists. A potential weakness is not specialization: some clients specifically seek out illustration-only agencies for deep expertise, whereas Making Pictures offers a broader service. However, they counter this by having specialized staff and a separate **@mp\_illustration Instagram** dedicated to illustrators ([Making Pictures (@mp\_illustration) • Instagram photos and videos](https://www.instagram.com/mp_illustration/?hl=en#:~:text=Making%20Pictures%20,illustrators%2C%20animators%20%26%20CGI%20artists)), which indicates they market each category to the right audience.  
* **Brand Image & Public Perception:** Making Pictures brands itself as a **modern, international artist management agency** with an emphasis on creativity and production value. The name “Making Pictures” itself suggests a focus on the craft of image-making in any form. Public perception in the UK is that Making Pictures is a leading rep for photographers and visual creatives (they’ve grown in prominence over the last decade). By expanding to North America, they also signal being a transatlantic bridge, which adds to their image as a growth-minded company. They are seen as very **producer-friendly** and solution-oriented – essentially if a client has a visual concept, Making Pictures will assemble the team to realize it, whether that’s through photography, illustration, film, or all of them. Their image is somewhat **less “artsy” and more “production/agency”** compared to some others: they pitch themselves as reliable partners to brands and agencies, not just curators of cool art. That resonates well with advertising clients who need that professionalism. They also communicate a bit about representation ethics and nurturing talent (their team page and communications emphasize the “team behind the talent” approach, similar to HF’s ethos of supporting artists closely) ([About • Handsome Frank • Home to the world's greatest illustrators](https://www.handsomefrank.com/about#:~:text=,team%20members%20discussing%20on%20couch)). The public (in creative industries) likely views Making Pictures as a **versatile and capable agency**, even if it doesn’t have the decades-old legacy of B\&A or the singular artistic aura of a boutique firm. It strikes a middle ground, which in perception means they are solid and trustworthy. If there’s a weaker aspect to their image, it might be that they are one of several newer-gen agencies and have to continuously differentiate themselves – but their multi-disciplinary model and global offices do give them an edge in image as a “go-to” production partner.  
* **Revenue & Profitability:** With offices on two continents and a wide service offering, Making Pictures must maintain substantial revenue. They handle end-to-end production which means beyond just commission, they likely charge production fees, art buying fees, etc. For instance, a full photo+illustration campaign managed by them could bring in revenue from creative direction, production management, and usage licensing across both mediums. Their investment in opening LA and Vancouver suggests business was strong enough to support expansion. They likely have retainer arrangements or preferred vendor status with certain big clients, ensuring steady income. Profitability would depend on keeping a steady pipeline of projects across all categories; the fact that they label themselves as *“your global partner for cutting-edge production”* ([Agency Info \- Making Pictures](https://making-pictures.com/agency-info/#:~:text=Making%20Pictures)) indicates they aim to be involved in production (which is typically higher revenue than just matchmaking artists to clients). They have a fairly large team (multiple agents and producers listed on the site ([Agency Info \- Making Pictures](https://making-pictures.com/agency-info/#:~:text=,13%3A%20Tim%20Higgs)) ([Agency Info \- Making Pictures](https://making-pictures.com/agency-info/#:~:text=,Eleni%20Peters))), so overhead is not trivial – they need constant projects to support that. Given their growth, it appears they have achieved that balance. In the competitive UK/US markets, they seem to be doing well financially through differentiation. One risk is the cost of operating in multiple locations and the competition in those markets, but by having a footprint in creative hubs (London, LA) they also open themselves to more opportunities. Overall, Making Pictures likely enjoys healthy revenues by capitalizing on integrated projects and having a finger in many pots of the visual content economy.  
* **Fame & Publicity Strategies:** Making Pictures has steadily built its profile via **industry engagement and curated showcases**. They maintain separate social media channels for different arms (e.g., @makingpicturessoho for photography and general, @mp\_illustration for illustration) ([Making Pictures (@mp\_illustration) • Instagram photos and videos](https://www.instagram.com/mp_illustration/?hl=en#:~:text=Making%20Pictures%20,illustrators%2C%20animators%20%26%20CGI%20artists)), which helps target their messaging. They also produce a **monthly newsletter** that highlights creative work and news ([Agency Info \- Making Pictures](https://making-pictures.com/agency-info/#:~:text=With%20offices%20in%20Europe%20,Film%2C%20Illustration%2C%20Animation%20and%20CGI)) – this kind of regular digest keeps them on the radar of art buyers and producers who subscribe. In terms of publicity, they have been featured in articles about representation (their founders or partners occasionally comment in industry pieces about how to get an agent, etc., which appears on forums or blogs ([How do photographers get signed with an agency? : r/photography](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/i0uaa4/how_do_photographers_get_signed_with_an_agency/#:~:text=How%20do%20photographers%20get%20signed,extensively%20as%20an%20assistant))). Being listed in directories like **Production Paradise** or on sites like **Agency Spotter** also provides them exposure (they’ve ensured their profile exists on such platforms). They might not have flashy PR campaigns, but they leverage the successes of their artists – for example, if an illustrator wins an award or a photographer’s campaign wins a Cannes Lions award, Making Pictures will amplify that news, aligning the agency with that success. They also host portfolio events; in the past, agencies like them often do “portfolio showings” at ad agencies or client offices – with global reach, they can showcase a traveling portfolio in multiple cities. Their fame is growing organically; as they attach their name to more noteworthy projects, word-of-mouth among clients increases. They seem to focus on **relationship-based marketing** – ensuring their existing clients are happy (leading to repeat business and referrals) – over splashy advertising of their own brand. This is common in B2B creative services. So far, that approach has worked: they are recognized in the UK as a top representation agency and making headway in North America. The only challenge publicity-wise is ensuring the Making Pictures brand itself is remembered (since they promote individual artists heavily, which is good, but they also want clients to think of *them* when new needs arise). By consistently branding all communications (e.g., the newsletter is clearly from Making Pictures, the social media posts carry their logo/style), they tackle that.  
* **Digital Presence & Marketing:** Making Pictures has a polished digital presence reflecting its production savvy. Their **website** is well-structured, with sections for each category of talent and plenty of visuals. It emphasizes their global availability and integrated services (“with offices in Europe and North America…” is front and center) ([Agency Info \- Making Pictures](https://making-pictures.com/agency-info/#:~:text=Making%20Pictures)), which is a selling point. They list their team contacts, making it easy for clients to reach the right agent (transparency and approachability). The site also provides news articles (case studies of recent projects), which not only demonstrate their work but also aid in SEO for those project types. Marketing content, like blog posts or interviews with their artists, might be less frequent on their site, but they supplement that with the newsletter and social media. On Instagram, their illustration account showcases new artwork from their illustrators, often tagging the client and context, which effectively serves as a mini case-study feed to attract similar clients. Their main Instagram might highlight behind-the-scenes of shoots or multi-disciplinary projects, showing their production capabilities. They also utilize LinkedIn to share company updates, tapping into a more corporate audience. Their marketing strategy is to present themselves as a **solutions provider**: messaging often revolves around “we have this exceptional roster and can produce your vision globally.” They likely do direct outreach as well – for example, sending tailored presentations to potential clients in industries they want to penetrate, using the combined portfolio of their artists. In terms of effectiveness, this multi-channel, professional approach helps Making Pictures gain credibility. They come across as a **slick, reliable partner** in digital communications. They might not have the indie charm of some smaller agencies, but they likely win points with brand managers who need assurance of execution. In summary, Making Pictures’ digital marketing is aligned with their identity: globally present, visually driven, and service-oriented.
