* **Ability to Attract and Retain Top Artists:** Leading agencies are magnets for top-tier talent. **Attracting sought-after artists** often comes down to the agency’s reputation (artists want to be in good company), the promise of high-quality clients/projects, and the support the agency provides. For example, an agency known for big brand deals and excellent management will draw established illustrators looking for representation. Many of the listed competitors have rosters that include famous names in illustration/design, indicating their success in this regard. **Retention** is equally important – agencies keep their stars happy through fair commissions, active promotion, career guidance, and sometimes by offering new opportunities (like cross-disciplinary projects or licensing deals). Those that treat artists not just as contract contributors but as partners tend to keep them long-term. Handsome Frank’s principle of building “close relationships” and delivering top-notch project management for artists ([About • Handsome Frank • Home to the world's greatest illustrators](https://www.handsomefrank.com/about#:~:text=,team%20members%20discussing%20on%20couch)) exemplifies a practice that likely improves retention. A stable roster allows agencies to continuously leverage the reputations and client followings of their artists.
