Internationally, Agent Pekka brought a fresh competitive energy to the illustration agency sector. By curating a roster that mixed Scandinavian talents with international artists, and by stressing quality over quantity, they carved out a niche that some older agencies had overlooked. Their success demonstrated that even a small agency from a small country could compete at the highest level, provided the talent was excellent and the approach professional. This may have influenced other agencies to up their game in terms of artist care and global outreach. Agent Pekka also showed a model of how to maintain a **boutique ethos while scaling globally**. Unlike some agencies that focus only on their region, Agent Pekka remained globally minded from the start, which perhaps inspired a more global outlook in the industry as a whole.
