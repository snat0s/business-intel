* **Reputation and Brand:** Among illustrators, Agent Pekka is well-regarded as a forward-looking agency. It was founded in 2007, which is relatively recent, yet it rose to prominence by about 2012 with that Amsterdam expansion and showcases. In comparisons, older agencies like CIA or Folio (est. decades ago) have long-standing industry relationships. Agent Pekka had to differentiate itself – which it did by being very **international (bridging Nordic talent with global clients)** and focusing on a *cool*, contemporary vibe. Their Instagram and promotions highlight stylish work, attracting clients who specifically *don’t* want the ordinary. As one article put it, Agent Pekka had a “killer reputation” even as it entered the central Europe market. This indicates that, qualitatively, Agent Pekka competes on the **basis of taste and trendsetting**.
