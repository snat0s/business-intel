Agent Pekka was founded in 2007 by Santtu Parikka, Pablo Steffa, and Harri Hännikäinen with a bold vision: to represent Finnish illustration talent on the international stage ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=idea%20for%20starting%20an%20illustration,agency%20operations%20are%20the%20norm)). The idea was born out of a real need in Finland’s creative industry. At the time, Finland had an abundance of gifted illustrators but lacked an established agent system to connect them with clients, unlike larger countries where illustration agencies were the norm ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=same%20roof%2C%20where%20they%E2%80%99d%20be,activity%20had%20not%20been%20established)). Parikka and Hännikäinen – both involved in a digital image production company (Fake Graphics) – noticed this “missing link” between Finnish illustrators and potential clients, especially overseas. They pitched the concept to Pablo Steffa, a designer with advertising and graphic arts experience, who embraced the challenge of marketing and selling his colleagues’ expertise ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=teht%C3%A4v%C3%A4kseen%20kollegojen%20osaamisen%20markkinoinnin%20ja,his%20colleagues%E2%80%99%20expertise%20his%20task)) ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=The%20answer%20on%20the%20phone,digital%20image%20production%20and%20service)). Together, the trio created Agent Pekka (named as a friendly, fictional “Agent Pekka” who would even answer the phone), aiming to bring a new collaborative model to Finland’s illustration scene.
