**11\. San Francisco (USA):** *Tech Industry Infuses Illustration Demand.* San Francisco and the Bay Area have become a prominent market for illustration thanks to the tech sector. Companies like Google, Facebook (Meta), Apple, and countless startups have popularized the use of **illustration in user interfaces, branding, and advertising** – think of the many websites/apps adorned with custom illustration to convey friendliness or explain services. The Bay Area’s design aesthetic often includes whimsical or flat-style illustrations, creating a steady stream of work for illustrators. **Industries:** Technology (illustrations for app tutorials, marketing websites, and explainer videos), **finance** (San Francisco’s fintech and finance companies using illustration for simplification of complex info), and **editorial media** (tech-oriented publications like *Wired*, based in SF, famously use bold illustration). There’s also a significant gaming presence (with companies like Electronic Arts, and many mobile game developers in SF) that commission concept art and marketing art. *Notable agencies:* Some specialized agencies popped up in SF to serve tech (e.g., **500px Prime** for stock illustration, though more a platform). However, most illustration work in SF might be handled by design agencies or directly by in-house teams. Still, agencies like **IllustrationX** have West Coast agents, and **Agent Pekka** has clients in SF given the tech focus on infographics and icons (Agent Pekka itself highlights iconography as a specialty). Additionally, **Giant Artists** and **John Brewster Creative** are reps that handle illustrators in the Bay Area. A statistic reflecting SF’s prominence: a study found **San Francisco to be the top city for “graphic illustrators” in the U.S.** based on salary and opportunity. This is likely due to high tech salaries and demand. In summary, SF’s role in the illustration market is relatively new but huge – it transformed how modern brands use illustration, thus injecting significant revenue into the field via corporate commissions.
