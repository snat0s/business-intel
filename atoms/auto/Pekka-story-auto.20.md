As Agent Pekka’s profile rose, the company hit several key milestones that marked its evolution from a startup to an internationally recognized agency. One of the first major accolades came in 2011, when Agent Pekka was honored as **“Graphic Designer of the Year”** in Finland – a notable recognition awarded by the Finnish design organizations Ornamo and Grafia ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=Vuoden%20graafikko%20graphic%20designer%20of,the%20Year)). This was an unprecedented win for an illustration agency (as opposed to an individual designer). The award citation praised Agent Pekka for *“successfully instilling a new culture of illustration in Finland”* and noted that *“the influence of Agent Pekka on the world conquest of Finnish illustration cannot be ignored.”* ([Muotoilijat '11 Finnish Designer Awards by ORNAMO \- Issuu](https://issuu.com/ornamo/docs/muotoilijat11_web_7019b42551bf77#:~:text=teht%C3%A4v%C3%A4kseen%20kollegojen%20osaamisen%20markkinoinnin%20ja,his%20colleagues%E2%80%99%20expertise%20his%20task)). This milestone underscored how significantly Agent Pekka had changed the Finnish graphic arts landscape in just a few years, professionalizing the field of illustration and helping local artists reach global audiences.
