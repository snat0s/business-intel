**Market Size:** The illustration agency sector is substantial. As noted, the **global Illustration Agency Service market** was about **$16.5 billion in 2023** and is forecast to grow to over $26 billion by 2030\. This figure likely represents the total value of projects facilitated by agencies (i.e. the fees paid to illustrators via agencies, which include both the artists’ earnings and agencies’ commissions). It underscores that a large portion of illustratio ([80 illustration statistics: trends, career, and more](https://www.linearity.io/blog/illustration-statistics/#:~:text=7,10)) flows through agencies, especially in advertising and publishing where clients often prefer to work with trusted agents for finding talent. If the top five agency companies account for a significant share (as one report suggests), it indicates some concentration at the high end, but overall the agency market is still quite fragmented with many boutique agencies worldwide.
