### Risk Factors & Contingencies
- **Expansion Pace**: If founding agent recruitment slows, shift resources to improving existing locations
- **Technology Development**: If SaaS platform development takes longer, prioritize high-end licensing manually
- **AI Model Development**: If AI model training faces technical challenges, focus on traditional visual style licensing
- **Paris Gallery-Restaurant**: If funding or partnership issues arise, consider pop-up or alternative venue models
- **Brand Collaborations**: If brand acquisition is slow, focus on existing client relationships and case study development
- **Market Conditions**: Adjust expansion pace based on economic conditions in target markets
- **Revenue Mix**: Shift resources to highest-performing channels if certain initiatives underperform
