### Step 5: Marketing and Promotion
- **Target Audience**:
  - Focus on high-end brands, publishers, and game developers, with an emphasis on new markets like China, where licensing can pave the way for commissioned projects.
- **Channels**:
  - Deploy the additional sales force from Paris, Shanghai, and future offices to cultivate local client relationships.
  - Promote the platform through industry events, social media, and strategic partnerships (e.g., with local art institutions or brands).
- **Launch Strategy**:
  - Showcase past high-value deals (e.g., with Apple or Louis Vuitton) to establish a premium reputation.
  - Offer introductory promotions or bundles for new clients in expansion markets.
