**3\. Tokyo (Japan):** *Massive Domestic Illustration Demand.* Tokyo is unique on this list: it has a colossal market for illustration, though the agency *model* is less traditional. Japan’s love of illustration permeates **publishing (manga, novels, magazines)**, **advertising**, **gaming**, and **merchandise/character licensing**. Many illustrators in Tokyo work directly with publishers or game companies, but agencies and agents are increasingly part of the ecosystem, especially for connecting Japanese artists with international clients and vice versa. Some global agencies have representation in Japan (e.g., **IllustrationX Japan**, **Dutch Uncle Tokyo**). The scale is indicated by metrics like the ¥24.7 billion creator illustration market in 2023 (which includes online commission platforms), and that’s *in addition* to the traditional corporate commissions. **Industries:** Publishing is huge – every light novel or manga series has cover illustrators; advertising in Japan frequently uses mascots and custom art; the video game and anime industries commission concept art, promotional illustrations, and DVD/Blu-ray cover art; even J-Pop music releases often feature illustrated cover art. *Notable agencies/players:* **AMU (Amana Illustration)** and other local talent management firms, as well as **PIE International** (which pub ([The Creator Economy Market Grew Remarkably in Its Major five Areas for FY2023 | Yano Research Market solution provider](https://www.yanoresearch.com/press/press.php/3635#:~:text=The%20size%20of%20the%20creator,yen%20for%20fan%20club%20platforms)) tration works). While Tokyo may not have as many stand-alone illustration agencies as New York or London, the sheer volume of work (and specialist agent-like entities within publishing houses or production companies) makes it one of the top cities by revenue generated from illustration. Tokyo illustrators are in high demand across Asia, and many Western franchises hire Tokyo-based artists for their distinctive style.
