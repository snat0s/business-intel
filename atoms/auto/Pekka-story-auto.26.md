Logistical and operational challenges also arose as Agent Pekka expanded geographically. Managing offices across different time zones and cultures required careful coordination. The founders met this by hiring experienced local agents/managers (as in Amsterdam) and by fostering a strong internal culture of collaboration despite distance. The agency describes itself as a *“global collaboration agency,”* highlighting teamwork across its international team ([Agent Pekka (@agentpekka) • Instagram photos and videos](https://www.instagram.com/agentpekka/#:~:text=We%27re%20a%20global%20collaboration%20agency,Amsterdam%20and%20work%20everywhere)). Embracing technology was another triumph – being digitally savvy helped Agent Pekka coordinate with clients and artists worldwide. (In fact, one of the co-founders, Santtu Parikka, had a tech background, which likely aided in implementing efficient digital workflows).
