Having a clear exit strategy protects the artist’s rights (e.g. the art license should end if the deal is terminated early) and lets the brand cut ties if something goes awry. Both parties should also clarify what happens with unsold inventory and marketing materials if the collaboration ends. Planning for worst-case scenarios may save a lot of legal and financial trouble later.
