**i. Enhance Digital Tools and Client Experience:** In the digital transformation sense, Agent Pekka can invest in tools that improve client experience and efficiency. For instance, developing a **slick online portfolio system** where clients can shortlist and compare artists or see availability could streamline hiring (some agencies have client login portals or interactive PDFs; Agent Pekka could innovate with a mini app or a chatbot on the site that recommends artists based on client needs). Internally, adopting project management software to coordinate across Helsinki-Amsterdam-LA will ensure timely delivery and communications, which clients will appreciate. Perhaps create an **online scheduling system** for quick calls or portfolio reviews with the agency, making it easy for prospective clients to connect (reducing friction can win projects). These small tech improvements can make Agent Pekka punch above its weight in professionalism. Additionally, since remote collaboration is now standard, highlighting capabilities like “we excel at remote project execution across time zones” and using collaboration tech (video calls, shared boards, etc.) in the workflow can reassure clients that distance is no barrier with Agent Pekka – a lesson reinforced by the pandemic era and something larger competitors also had to adapt to.
