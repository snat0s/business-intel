**Regional insights:** The agency market has traditionally been strongest in North America and Europe, where many of the oldest and largest illustration agencies are based (e.g., in New York and London). These regions have a mature advertising sector that frequently leverages agency-represented illustrators for campaigns. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific is a smaller portion of the agency market but is expanding; countries like Japan, South Korea, and Australia have growing numbers of agencies or agent-like platforms.
