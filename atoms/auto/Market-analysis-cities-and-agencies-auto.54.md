Within the broader illustration industry, the illustration agency business forms a significant subset. Illustration agencies are firms that represent illustrators and connect them with clients, handling promotion, contract negotiation, and project management on the artists’ behalf. The total value of illustration work handled via agencies globally was estimated at around $16.5 billion in 2023\. This represents the aggregate fees or billings managed through agencies (including what clients pay for the art, of which agencies take a commission). The agency segment is growing briskly – projected to reach about $26.3 billion by 2030 (nearly 60% growth) at \~9.7% CAGR – thanks to rising demand for high-quality, curated artwork in marketing and media.
