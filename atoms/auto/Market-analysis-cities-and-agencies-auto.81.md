**20\. Mexico City (Mexico):** \*Advertising and Media for the Spanish-Speaki ([Norte](https://norte.art.br/#:~:text=Norte%20Norte%20is%20an%20artists,become%20experts%20in%20copyright%20management)) exico City is a powerhouse in the Spanish-language advertising world. It serves not only Mexico (a nation of 120M people) but often the broader Lat ([GERA Illustration Agency](https://gera.art.br/#:~:text=GERA%20Illustration%20Agency%20NEW%20WORKS,Uber%20Eats)) market as a creative center. **Industries:** Advertising (major multinational ad agencies operate in CDMX, creating campaigns for consumer products, soda brands, etc., many of which employ illustration especially in print/outdoor and increasingly in digital content), **publishing** (Mexico has a sizeable publishing industry for textbooks and literature – illustrators are commissioned for children’s books and educational illustrations in large numbers by publishers like Fondo de Cultura, etc.), and **film/TV** (Mexico’s film industry and streaming content sometimes use illustrators for poster art or animation storyboard – e.g., animated segments in films, or poster art for the vibrant film festival scene). *Notable agencies:* Mexico has some local illustration agencies or artist reps (though not as internationally famous). For instance, **Pequeño Press** doubles as a boutique agency for illustrators, and **Grupo Ilustradores** is a network. Many Mexican illustrators also join Latin American collectives or get representation through Spain/US agencies for international work. Nevertheless, Mexico City’s creative industry size ensures constant demand for artwork – one indicator, the number of animation and design studios in Mexico City that routinely hire freelance illustrators. In Latin America, Mexico’s illustration market is second only to Brazil’s. Given its regional influence and the confluence of media in the capital, Mexico City rounds out the top 20 list.
