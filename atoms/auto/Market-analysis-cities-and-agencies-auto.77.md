**15\. Seoul (South Korea):** *Gaming and Pop Culture Illustration Nexus.* Seoul has become a significant market, mainly propelled by South Korea’s massive **gaming industry** and the rise of **K-pop/pop culture** that utilizes a lot of art. Many popular mobile games (and PC games) are developed in Korea, and illustrators are needed for character design, concept art, and promotional artwork. Additionally, Korea’s webtoon (online comics) industry is huge and, while often creator-owned, has spawned a professional ecosystem for comic illustrators (some of whom crossover into commercial illustration). **Industries:** Video games (companies like NCSoft, Nexon, Netmarble – all Seoul-based – employ or contract armies of illustrators), **publishing** (Korean publishers of novels and educational content commission illustrators; also the manhwa/webtoon publishers), and **advertising** (Korean advertising is vibrant, sometimes using anime-style or cute character illustrations in ads for consumer products and tech). K-pop music labels also commission illustrators for album art, merchandise (stickers, character goods of idols), and animated music videos. *Notable agencies:* South Korea has a few illustration reps – e.g., **Yeon Illustration Agency** connects international illustrators with clients in Korea. There are also talent agencies that manage webtoon artists who occasionally take on commercial jobs. International agencies haven’t deeply penetrated Korea yet, but some Korean illustrators are represented by overseas agents to get work outside Korea. Seoul’s illustration market value is significant domestically (many illustrators make a good living via game and comic work), and an increasing amount flows through agencies or agent-like platforms. Seoul ranks in the top 20 for the sheer volume of illustration content produced for its entertainment sector.
