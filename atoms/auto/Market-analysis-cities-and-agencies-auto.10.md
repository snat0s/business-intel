* **Global Scale:** Analysts and industry experts suggest the worldwide market for commissioned and licensed illustration is on the order of **tens of billions of dollars annually**. One analysis indicates that the **illustration agency services** segment alone (the portion of work mediated by agencies) was about **$16.5 billion in 2023** and projected to reach $26.3 billion by 2030\. Since not all illustrators use agencies, the *total* illustration market (including direct ([80 illustration statistics: trends, career, and more](https://www.linearity.io/blog/illustration-statistics/#:~:text=7,10)) to-client commissions) is even larger. It’s reasonable to estimate the overall global illustration market (all licensed commissions) in the ballpark of **$10–20+ billion per year** in the mid-2020s, given the agency-mediated portion and the significant volume of direct commissions worldwide.
