Economic ups and downs tested the agency as well. Founded just before the late-2000s global financial crisis, Agent Pekka had to prove its value when marketing budgets were tight. Its survival and growth through that period is a testament to the quality of work delivered; clients continued to invest in standout illustration as a way to differentiate their brands, and Agent Pekka’s artists provided that edge. Later, as the industry shifted more toward digital content in the 2010s, the agency expanded into areas like CGI, animation and moving image to meet new demand ([Agent Pekka Launches In Amsterdam With An Art Exhibition | LBBOnline](https://lbbonline.com/news/agent-pekka-launches-in-amsterdam-with-an-art-exhibition#:~:text=Established%20in%202007%2C%20Agent%20Pekka,Adidas%2C%20Adobe%2C%20Sony%2C%20Warner%20Music)). This diversification was a triumph of adaptability – it ensured Agent Pekka stayed relevant when clients needed not just static illustrations but also motion graphics, character designs for video, and other new media content.
